Among fish key innovations, bioluminescence is critical to the success of many deep-sea fishes. Understanding evolutionary dynamics of deep-sea fish lineages and the role bioluminescent light organs have on their evolution is a continuing effort of many deep-sea biologists. This study focused on assessing how bioluminescent structures involved with sexual communication may be impacting the evolution of body shape in the lanternfishes (Myctophiformes), a lineage of fishes possessing some of the most extensive sexual dimorphism in bioluminescent structures seen in deep-sea organisms. Results from this study using geometric morphometrics integrated with a phylogenetic hypothesis of lanternfish relationships suggest there is significant evolutionary modularity between the caudal peduncle and the rest of the body within lanternfishes. Our results also show that most lanternfish species lacking caudal light organs cluster together in morphospace (Diaphus, Hintonia, Neo-scopelidae), possess enlarged headlight organs (Diaphus), and exhibit lower phylogenetic signal than species possessing caudal light organs. These results support the hypothesis that lanternfish body-shape evolution is influenced by selective pressures on their light-producing tail organs and that the importance of caudal light organs in lanternfish communication may result in differential selection on the caudal area in species that possess them. One possible interpretation for why lanternfishes without caudal light organs coalesce in morphospace may be that by removing the caudal light organ, natural selection would select for a lanternfish caudal morphology optimized for the physical landscape of the midwater that they live in, favoring more energy effi-cient and slow sustained swimming styles.\\nC1 [Martin, Rene P.; Smith, W.

In situ observations of pelagic detritus on the abyssal plain are very scarce. Carcasses are rapidly scavenged and shells may dissolve owing to undersaturation of deep waters with respect to CaCO3. We observed more than 300 egg cases of the epipelagic cephalopod Argonauta sp. in 9 large seafloor image surveys investigated across the Clarion Clipperton Zone in the Pacific between 2010 and 2020. Females of this octopus produce calcite egg cases that are used for buoyancy and as substrate on which to attach their eggs in the water column. These cases sink to the seafloor, presumably upon death of the octopus. In one area, between 3970 and 4551 m water depth surveyed in 2019, we documented more than 200 complete and fragments of egg cases (5.84 +/- 1.8 cm in size) on the seafloor, complete and broken and in various states of dissolution. Here, we present observations of egg case dissolution in situ and of 99 white deposits that were likely largely dissolved egg cases. Our observations reveal a previously undocumented pathway of epipelagic inorganic carbon to the abyssal plain. Preliminary estimations indicate that the local contribution of Argonauta egg cases to the vertical transport of carbonates is likely small compared to other planktonic calcifiers, but the geographic extent of the deposition in the eastern Pacific is apparently large. This study highlights the need for in situ observations to discover and document carbon fluxes in the deep sea, and for consideration of life history traits in unraveling elusive pathways within the biological pump.\\nC1 [Hoving, H.

The extensive data set facilitates an assessment of various wave height and period distribution models in shallow and intermediate waters. The results reveal that the relative wave height H-s/D (where H-s is the significant wave height and D the water depth) can serve as a key indicator in choosing the distribution with least error in a given sea state. The Naess model is found to be the most accurate in describing the tail of the wave height distribution in a sea state for low relative wave heights (H-s/D < 0.2), and the depth-dependent van Vledder model for high relative heights (H-s/D > 0.4). In between these sea states, a transition in the performance of the deep-water and the depth-dependent models is visible. When details of the spectrum are not available, the Weibull distribution is the most accurate amongst applicable models, in spite of considerable variability in its parameter values. While the spectral bandwidth appears to have minimal impact on the distribution of wave heights in a sea state, it does appear to influence the relationship between characteristic wave periods. Based on measurements, these are found to deviate from empirical relationships proposed, for example, by the US Army Coastal Engineering Manual. Improved formulas that incorporate the spectral width are therefore proposed.\\nC1 [James, Jemerson P.; Panchang, Vijay] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Ocean Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.\\nRP James, JP (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Ocean Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.\\nEM jemersonpjames@tamu.edu\\nOI James, Jemerson P/0000-0002-3787-4604\\nNR 41\\nTC 0\\nZ9 0\\nU1 1\\nU2 1\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

We use a hierarchy of models to investigate the time-dependent response of the MOC and low-latitude pycnocline depth (which quantifies the stratification) to SO wind stress changes: a two-layer analytical theory, a multicolumn model (PyMOC), and an idealized general circulation model (GCM). We find that in both the GCM and PyMOC, the MOC has a multidecadal adjustment time scale while the pycnocline depth has a multicentennial time scale. The two-layer theory instead predicts the MOC and pycnocline depth to adjust on the same, multidecadal time scale. We argue that this discrepancy arises because the pycnocline depth depends on the bulk stratification, while the MOC amplitude is sensitive mostly to isopycnals within the overturning cell. We can reconcile the discrepancy by interpreting the \"pycnocline depth\" in the theory as the depth of a specific isopycnal near the maximum of the MOC. We also find that SO stationary eddies respond very quickly to a sudden wind stress change, compensating for most of the change in the Ekman-driven MOC. This effect is missing in the theory, where the eddy-induced MOC only follows the adjustment of the pycnocline depth. Our results emphasize the importance of depth dependence in the oceans\\' transient response to changes in surface boundary conditions, and the distinct role played by stationary eddies in the SO. Significance StatementOur work resolves the question of why previous theories predict the ocean density structure to adjust to a change in the winds over the Southern Ocean within centuries, while climate models indicate that this adjustment takes thousands of years. The question is important because it is related to our understanding of how the ocean responds to potential climate change scenarios. Our results emphasize the importance of depth dependence in the density response (i.e., the upper ocean adjusts faster than the deep ocean), suggesting that future theoretical advancement should be made with careful considerations of the ocean\\'s vertical structure. Our results also highlight the role of stationary meanders in the Southern Ocean\\'s Antarctic Circumpolar Current, whose influence has not been included in the existing theories.\\nC1 [Kong, Hailu; Jansen, Malte F.] Univ Chicago, Dept Geophys Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.\\nRP Kong, HL (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Dept Geophys Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.\\nEM hlkong.uchicago@gmail.com\\nFU University of Chicago Research Computing Center; National Science\\n   Foundation (NSF) [OCE-1912163];  [OCE-1846821]\\nFX We thank two anonymous reviewers for helping to improve the manuscript.\\n   Computational resources for this project were generously provided by the\\n   University of Chicago Research Computing Center.

Here, we analyze subpolar North Atlantic WMT in high- and low-resolution versions of the Community Earth System Model version 1 (CESM1) and investigate whether differences in resolution and climatological WMT impact low-frequency AMOC variability and the atmospheric response to this variability. We find that high-resolution simulations reproduce the WMT found in a reanalysis-forced high-resolution ocean simulation more accurately than low-resolution simulations. We also find that the low-resolution simulations, including one forced with the same atmospheric reanalysis data, have larger biases in surface heat fluxes, sea-surface temperatures, and salinities compared to the high-resolution simulations. Despite these major climatological differences, the mechanisms of low-frequency AMOC variability are similar in the high- and low-resolution versions of CESM1. The Labrador Sea WMT plays a major role in driving AMOC variability, and a similar North Atlantic Oscillation-like sea-level pressure pattern leads AMOC changes. However, the high-resolution simulation shows a pronounced atmospheric response to the AMOC variability not found in the low-resolution version. The consistent role of Labrador Sea WMT in low-frequency AMOC variability across high- and low-resolution coupled simulations, including a simulation which accurately reproduces the WMT found in an atmospheric-reanalysis-forced high-resolution ocean simulation, suggests that the mechanisms may be similar in nature.\\nC1 [Oldenburg, Dylan; Armour, Kyle C.; Thompson, LuAnne] Univ Washington, Sch Oceanog, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.\\n   [Wills, Robert C.

Yet, despite this critical role and conspicuous presence, little is known regarding most aspects of mesopelagic community ecology, including habitat associations at sub-basin spatial scales. Here we address several aspects of these data deficiencies in the eastern Bering Sea mesopelagic - a highly productive subarctic marine ecosystem home to multiple protected predator species and large commercial fisheries. Through 41 midwater trawls conducted at 250 m, 500 m and 1000 m depths during May of 1999 and 2000, and a series of generalized linear models and cluster analyses, we describe the influence of remotely sensed oceanographic habitat variables on the diel distribution, relative abundance and community composition of 30 species of mesopelagic fish and squid in 3 contrasting study areas. We then project the total energy available to predators at depth and across the eastern Bering Sea Basin based on the identified habitat constraints. Fishes from the families Bathylagidae and Myctophidae, and squids from the Gonatidae dominated the 72 species catch biomass (n = 225,000, 2,100 kg). The six most abundant species were equally divided between each of the three dominant families and are also the most highly represented mesopelagic species in eastern Bering Sea pelagic predator diets. Their association with surface habitat variables describe a complex and multifaceted relationship between physical/biological predictors and the total mesopelagic energy field during the spring bloom period in this ecosystem. Leuroglossus schmidti, Bathylagus pacificus, Stenobrachius leucopsaurus, S. nannochir, Gonatopsis borealis and Eogonatus tinro contrast in the suite of physical and biological variables that they respond to, and also in the character of their response. Although L. schmidti is of moderate caloric value, it expressed the greatest overall energy signature at all depths due to its overwhelming biomass, and response to the presence of specific, variable habitat conditions across extensive portions of the study area. Interannual variability in habitat variables forecasted a pronounced redistribution of dominant species and thereby total mesopelagic energy content - providing a potential mechanism for shifts in central-place predator habitat use, energy expenditure, and diet. The known relevance of mesopelagic species as prey and the energetic potential for apex predators foraging in the Basin illustrates a cautionary narrative regarding unregulated harvest of biota from this poorly understood and critically important oceanic zone.\\nC1 [Sinclair, E.

Composite analyses are conducted based on 17 anticyclonic eddies (AEs) and 19 cyclonic eddies (CEs). These westward propagating mesoscale eddies impinge on the Kuroshio at similar to 22 degrees N, similar to 124.5 degrees E and interact with the Kuroshio with a mean duration of similar to 70 days. During the interaction, all the eddy energy reservoirs and eddy-mean flow energy conversions exhibit complex spatial-temporal variations. In particular, during the strong interaction period (days 18-54), both AEs and CEs are deformed into an elliptic shape, with the major axis in the northeast-southwest direction due to the squeeze of surrounding eddies, and obtain kinetic energy from the mean flow. Overall, the eddies are weakened gradually after encountering the Kuroshio, with the energy of CEs decreased more rapidly than that of AEs. The eddies decay through two pathways: transferring similar to 8% of eddy available potential energy (EPE) to the mean flow, and converting similar to 64% of EPE to eddy kinetic energy (EKE) via the baroclinic instability with the majority of the EKE finally dissipated. The results suggest that although the time-dependent energy conversion terms vanish upon time averaging, they play important but opposite roles in the evolution of AEs and CEs. The analysis in this work is on the synoptic and intraseasonal time scales; hence, it provides a basis for understanding the long-term variations of the eddy-Kuroshio interaction and associated climate change.\\nC1 [Yan, Xiaomei; Pang, Chongguang; Zhang, Linlin; Liu, Hongwei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, CAS Key Lab Ocean Circulat & Waves, Qingdao, Peoples R China.\\n   [Yan, Xiaomei; Pang, Chongguang; Zhang, Linlin; Liu, Hongwei] Pilot Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol Qingdao, Qingdao, Peoples R China.\\n   [Yan, Xiaomei; Pang, Chongguang; Zhang, Linlin; Liu, Hongwei] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Ocean Megasci, Qingdao, Peoples R China.\\n   [Kang, Dujuan] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Environm Sci, New Brunswick, NJ USA.\\nRP Yan, XM (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, CAS Key Lab Ocean Circulat & Waves, Qingdao, Peoples R China.; Yan, XM (通讯作者)，Pilot Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol Qingdao, Qingdao, Peoples R China.; Yan, XM (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Ocean Megasci, Qingdao, Peoples R China.\\nEM yanxiaomei@qdio.ac.cn\\nFU Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation [ZR2021MD092]; National\\n   Natural Science Foundation of China [42122041, 41776021]; Strategic\\n   Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences\\n   [XDB42010105]\\nFX Acknowledgments.

RLs inhibit subsurface vertical mixing, isolating deeper ocean layers from the atmosphere. This process has been studied using observations and idealized simulations. The present ocean modeling study builds upon this body of work by incorporating spatially resolved and realistic atmospheric forcing. Fine-scale observations of the upper ocean collected during the Dynamics of the Madden-Julian Oscillation field campaign are used to verify the General Ocean Turbulence Model (GOTM). Spatiotemporal characteristics of equatorial Indian Ocean RLs are then investigated by forcing a 2D array of GOTM columns with realistic and well-resolved output from an existing regional atmospheric simulation. RL influence on the ocean-atmosphere system is evaluated through analysis of RL-induced modification to surface fluxes and sea surface temperature (SST). This analysis demonstrates that RLs cool the ocean surface on time scales longer than the associated precipitation event. A second simulation with identical atmospheric forcing to that in the first, but with rainfall set to zero, is performed to investigate the role of rain temperature and salinity stratification in maintaining cold SST anomalies within RLs. Approximately one third, or 0.1 degrees C, of the SST reduction within RLs can be attributed to rain effects, while the remainder is attributed to changes in atmospheric temperature and humidity. The prolonged RL-induced SST anomalies enhance SST gradients that have been shown to favor the initiation of atmospheric convection. These findings encourage continued research of RL feedbacks to the atmosphere.\\nC1 [Shackelford, Kyle; DeMott, Charlotte A.; van Leeuwen, Peter Jan] Colorado State Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.\\n   [van Leeuwen, Peter Jan] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading, Berks, England.\\n   [Thompson, Elizabeth] NOAA, Phys Sci Lab, Boulder, CO USA.\\n   [Hagos, Samson] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Richland, WA 99352 USA.\\nRP Shackelford, K (通讯作者)，Colorado State Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.\\nEM kshack@colostate.edu\\nRI ; van Leeuwen, Peter Jan/A-1271-2010; DeMott, Charlotte/L-7414-2015\\nOI Thompson, Elizabeth/0000-0002-0131-4170; van Leeuwen, Peter\\n   Jan/0000-0003-2325-5340; Hagos, Samson/0000-0001-7591-9933; Shackelford,\\n   Kyle/0000-0002-1327-2721; DeMott, Charlotte/0000-0002-3975-1288\\nFU NSF Physical Oceanography division [1924659]; European Research Council\\n   [694509]\\nFX The authors acknowledge and thank Kyla Drushka and Suneil Iyer for\\n   thoughtful feedback on this analysis.

During the survey, on the upstream side, upwelling/downwelling is found above/below an eastward subsurface current maximum due to an unusual mesoscale eddy. This eddy detached from a meander in the eastward North Equatorial Countercurrent in May 2013 and translated southwestward to the islands over 2 months bringing among the strongest currents seen at these islands in altimetry from 1993 to 2020. Following a streamline, the flow satisfied the Bernoulli equation outside of the wake. In both the cyclonic and anticyclonic wakes from the south and north points of Helen Reef, elevated estimated diffusivities from a shear-based parameterization were similar at 10(-5) m(2) s(-1) and a factor of 10 above background values. In the time series, downwelling in the upper 57 m is associated with a broader, surface-intensified NECC converging at topography. Also, the shallower thermocline in 2014 and during the El Ninos of 2015-2016 and 2018-2019 led to increased stratification at this depth and permitted greater internal wave activity. Peaked semidiurnal internal waves with peak-to-peak amplitudes of 4 degrees C were equal to interannual changes. The net downwelling/warming of 0.5 degrees C at the temperature array when smoothed over 2 months is consistent with both current-driven downwelling and internal-wave driven mixing of warmer waters downwards.\\nC1 [Johnston, T.

A calibration is performed considering 1 year (2012) and 31 simulations, evaluated against altimeter and buoy data through six error metrics and Q-Q plots. Assessment results suggest that both ST4 and ST6 provide good results when WAVEWATCH III is properly adjusted for the wind input. Nevertheless, the wave model presents a positive bias of significant wave height when forced by CFSR winds that requires attention. The investigation in the spectral domain indicates a better performance of wave simulations forced by ERA5 winds, especially for wave periods below 10 s. For wave periods above 10 s, the choice of source term package becomes more important. In this regard, ST4 parameterization combined with ERA5 winds presents the best results for the region. The optimal range of calibration parameters for each wind input and source term package is reported and discussed.\\nC1 [Kaiser, Julia; Nogueira, Izabel C.

However, model and dynamical uncertainties present a significant challenge when attempting to incorporate these forecasts into a formal decision-making process. To provide guidance on the reliability of dynamical forecasts, previous studies have suggested that deterministic climate processes associated with atmospheric or oceanic teleconnections may provide opportunities for enhanced forecast skill. Recent computational advances have led to the availability of subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) forecasts of key oceanic variables such as sea surface height (SSH), which may be leveraged to identify such \"forecast opportunities.\" In this study, we conduct a S2S forecast skill assessment of SSH anomalies in the CCS using an ensemble of 46-day reforecasts made by the European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) model for the period 2000-2018. We find that the ECMWF model consistently produces skillful dynamical forecasts of SSH, particularly in both the southern and northern CCS at leads of 4-7 weeks. Using a high-resolution ocean reanalysis, we develop a new index designed to characterize the location and intensity of coastally trapped waves propagating through the CCS. We then show that the S2S dynamical forecasts have enhanced skill in forecasts of SSH in weeks 4-7 when initialized with strong or extreme coastally trapped wave conditions, explaining 30-40% more SSH variance than the corresponding persistence forecast.\\nC1 [Amaya, Dillon J.; Jacox, Michael G.; Dias, Juliana; Alexander, Michael A.; Scott, James D.; Gehne, Maria] NOAA, Phys Sci Lab, Earth Syst Res Lab, Boulder, CO 80305 USA.\\n   [Jacox, Michael G.] NOAA, Environm Res Dis, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Monterey, CA USA.\\n   [Karnauskas, Kristopher B.; Scott, James D.; Gehne, Maria] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO USA.\\n   [Karnauskas, Kristopher B.] Univ Colorado, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Boulder, CO USA.\\nRP Amaya, DJ (通讯作者)，NOAA, Phys Sci Lab, Earth Syst Res Lab, Boulder, CO 80305 USA.\\nEM dillon.amaya@noaa.gov\\nRI ; Alexander, Michael/A-7097-2013\\nOI Amaya, Dillon/0000-0001-6720-3265; Scott, James D/0000-0002-8709-8594;\\n   Jacox, Michael/0000-0003-3684-0717; Alexander,\\n   Michael/0000-0001-9646-6427\\nFU Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) at\\n   the University of Colorado Boulder; NOAA Climate Program Office\\'s\\n   Modeling, Analysis, Predictions, and Projections Program; NOAA Fisheries\\n   Office of Science and Technology\\nFX We thank George Kiladis and Brandon Wolding for their helpful comments\\n   over the course of this study.

Often reef boundary layer characteristics derived from a single instrument are assumed to accurately represent the study site. This approach relies on two assumptions: first, that the boundary layer is relatively homogeneous across the area of interest, and second, that two instruments displaced in space or with different spatiotemporal resolution would produce similar results when sampling the same flow. We deployed four velocimeters over a 15 x 20 m reef at 10 m depth in the Chagos Archipelago. The site had a 1 m tidal range, and waves were primarily locally generated wind waves with H-rms < 0.5 m. Depth-averaged currents were typically 0.2 m/s. Friction velocities derived directly from Reynolds stress measurements by fitting the law of the wall show agreement between instruments (pairwise coefficients of determination R-2 ranged from 0.53 to 0.86). Thus, the boundary layer appears to be spatially homogeneous, at least at the scale of our array, and it appears that in the present case friction velocities from one instrument are indeed generally representative of the site. We calculate drag coefficients using curve-fitting and Structure-from-Motion photogrammetry, and while we find general agreement between estimates one instrument in particular produces drag coefficients an order of magnitude larger in comparison. Hence, some variability between instruments was observed, notably when high-resolution instruments measured localized flow features.\\nC1 [Lindhart, M.; Monismith, S.

In the coastal Arctic, a large fraction of terrestrially sourced dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC and POC) is delivered by snowpack meltwaters of the spring freshet, when many coastal ocean regions remain covered by landfast ice. Here we report on an array of moored sensors and telemetering ice buoys deployed in advance of the 2018 spring freshet in Stefansson Sound near Prudhoe Bay, Alaska. This instrumented array monitored temporal and spatial variations in hydrographic properties before and during the freshet, as well as optical properties that serve as proxies for DOC and POC contained in the freshet plumes. The temporal evolution of these optical signals occurred in five stages, each associated with characteristic water column structural and kinematic characteristics. Spatial differences among fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) and optical backscatter (OBS) signals across the ice buoy array, evident later during the freshet, allowed identification of plume waters sourced from the Kuparuk, Sagavanirktok, and Shaviovik drainage basins.\\nC1 [Okkonen, Stephen R.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.\\n   [Laney, Samuel R.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\nRP Okkonen, SR (通讯作者)，Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.\\nEM srokkonen@alaska.edu\\nOI Okkonen, Stephen/0000-0003-0304-0094\\nFU National Aeronautics and Space Administration\\'s Carbon Cycle and\\n   Ecosystems program [NNX17AI72G]\\nFX The authors are grateful to the many people and organizations who\\n   contributed to the success of this work.

The response of active margin streams to base-level change due to eustatic sea level cycles is less well understood than passive margin streams, which form the basis of most sequence strati graphic models. The southern California margin offers an opportunity to investigate the evolution of small mountainous streams along a strike-slip margin over a sea-level cycle. High-resolution Chirp subbottom data were examined from the Silver Strand littoral cell in San Diego, California, which is located in a region of localized transtension associated with a step in the Newport Inglewood-Rose Canyon fault zone. Chirp data reveal active faulting on multiple fault strands, a subaerial surface likely formed from MIS 4 to MIS 2, fluvial incision associated with MIS 2, and the transgressive surface of erosion formed during sea-level rise from MIS 2 to MIS 1. Interpreted acoustic units observed in the data include the Cretaceous outcropping Rosario Group, Miocene to Pliocene prograding clinoforms, subaerial deposits associated with MIS 4 to MIS 3, channel fill and transgressive lag deposits formed during the most recent sea-level transgression, and Holocene marine sediment. The Chirp data examined in this study build upon findings from other seismic studies, sediment cores, trenching, and outcrops that have been examined on-and offshore San Diego. Combined, these data suggest that the fault controlled pull-apart basin formed in this region influences sediment transport and deposition throughout the last glacial cycle. During highstand, the fault-controlled wide shelf, subsiding basin, and circulation patterns result in trapping of sediment in San Diego Bay and nearshore, cutting off sediment delivery to the deep-sea. During lowstand, the fault-controlled morphology creates a drainage divide that deflects streams to the south which lengthens and reduces slope of the drainage pathways. These findings are in contrast to observations in other fault controlled littoral cells along the southern California margin where sediment delivery to the deep-sea remains active during highstands, highlighting the variability of stream response to base-level change along active strike-slip dominated margins.\\nC1 [Graves, Lana G.; Driscoll, Neal W.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.\\n   [Maloney, Jillian M.] San Diego State Univ, Dept Geol Sci, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.\\nRP Maloney, JM (通讯作者)，San Diego State Univ, Dept Geol Sci, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.\\nEM jmaloney@sdsu.edu\\nFU Unified Port of San Diego, California, USA\\nFX Funding for this project was provided by the Unified Port of San Diego,\\n   California, USA.

We attempt to rationalize the complex three-dimensional flow in terms of the superposition of a zonal (roughly along axis) and meridional (transverse) overturning pattern. Rates of overturning and the seasonal cycle of air-sea fluxes sustaining them are quantified and ranked in order of importance. Air-sea fluxes dominate the budget so that, at zero order, the magnitude and sense of the overturning circulation can be inferred from air-sea fluxes, with interior mixing playing a lesser role. We find that wintertime latent heat fluxes dominate the water-mass transformation rate in the interior waters of the Gulf leading to a diapycnal volume flux directed toward higher densities. In the zonal overturning cell, fluid is drawn in from the Sea of Oman through the Strait of Hormuz, transformed, and exits the Strait near the southern and bottom boundaries. Along the southern margin of the Gulf, evaporation plays an important role in the meridional overturning pattern inducing sinking there.\\nC1 [Al-Shehhi, Maryam R.] Khalifa Univ, Civil & Environm Engn, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates.\\n   [Song, Hajoon] Yonsei Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Seoul, South Korea.\\n   [Scott, Jeffery; Marshall, John] MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA USA.\\nRP Song, H (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Seoul, South Korea.\\nEM hajsong@yonsei.ac.kr\\nFU National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant [NRF-2019R1C1C1003663,\\n   NRF-2020R1A4A1016537]; Khalifa University\\nFX H.S. acknowledges the support by National Research Foundation of Korea\\n   (NRF) Grant (NRF-2019R1C1C1003663 and NRF-2020R1A4A1016537).

As such, it plays an important role in the climate system by transporting water and heat toward the pole and recirculating to the large-scale Indian Ocean through retroflection modes of its southern extension. Five cruise data sets and remote sensing data from different sensors are used to identify three states of the southern extension of the EMC: early retroflection, canonical retroflection, and no retroflection. Retroflections occur 47% of the time. EMC strength regulates the retroflection state, although impinged mesoscale eddies also contribute to retroflection formation. Early retroflection is linked with EMC volume transport. Anticyclonic eddies drifting from the central Indian Ocean to the coast favor early retroflection formation, anticyclonic eddies near the southern tip of Madagascar promote the generation of canonical retroflection, and no retroflection appears to be associated with a lower eddy kinetic energy (EKE). Knowledge of the EMC retroflection state could help predict (a) coastal upwelling south of Madagascar, (b) the southeastern Madagascar phytoplankton bloom, and (c) the formation of the South Indian Ocean Counter Current (SICC).\\nC1 [Ramanantsoa, Juliano D.; Rouault, M.] Univ Cape Town UCT, Dept Oceanog, Cape Town, South Africa.\\n   [Ramanantsoa, Juliano D.] Norwegian Res Ctr NORCE, Bergen, Norway.\\n   [Ramanantsoa, Juliano D.; Rouault, M.] Univ Cape Town UCT, Ma Re Inst, Nansen Tutu Marine Environm Res, Cape Town, South Africa.\\n   [Ramanantsoa, Juliano D.] Inst Halieut & Sci Marines IH SM, Toliara, Madagascar.\\n   [Penven, P.] Univ Brest, Lab Oceanog Phys & Spatiale LOPS, CNRS, IRD,IFREMER,IUEM, Brest, France.\\n   [Raj, R.

We examined diatom productivity and size-fractionated phytoplankton grazing losses to protozoan grazers in the northern Bering and Chukchi seas during June 2017. Sea ice was nearly absent and water temperatures were unseasonably warm; such conditions may be considered normal in future decades. Among 28 experiments conducted, five were in bloom conditions. Diatom biomass and production rates were similar to previous studies, suggesting the early ice retreat did not lead to appreciably reduced diatom growth. Statistical analyses showed that 77% of the variance in diatom growth rate could be explained by a combination of nutrients, light, and their interaction, but the interactive effect was most important (explaining 66% of the variance). Protozoan grazing intensity on phytoplankton was largely affected by size, specifically, grazing on larger phytoplankton (e.g. diatoms) was highly variable among stations, with many stations having unquantifiable rates. Protozoan grazers consumed an average of 23 +/- 35% of growth at bloom stations and 55 +/- 102% among non-bloom stations. For smaller phytoplankton, grazing was persistent and less variable spatially, consuming 64 +/- 38% of growth at bloom stations and 79 +/- 63% at non-bloom stations. Although previous studies (that did not size-fractionate samples) inferred that protozoan grazers control diatom biomass during blooms, our results suggest that diatom productivity largely escaped protozoan grazing losses, especially in bloom conditions, likely due to temporal lag between phytoplankton and protist biomass accumulation. Thus, during bloom conditions, it was estimated that 20-50 times more diatom organic matter was available for higher trophic levels and/or export (as opposed to water column remineralization) than under non-bloom conditions, despite only a 12-fold increase in gross diatom production in the bloom.\\nC1 [Krause, Jeffrey W.] Dauphin Isl Sea Lab, Dauphin Isl, AL 36528 USA.\\n   [Krause, Jeffrey W.] Univ S Alabama, Dept Marine Sci, Mobile, AL USA.\\n   [Lomas, Michael W.] Bigelow Lab Ocean Sci, East Boothbay, ME USA.\\n   [Danielson, Seth L.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Coll Fisheries & Ocean Sci, Fairbanks, AK USA.\\nRP Krause, JW (通讯作者)，Dauphin Isl Sea Lab, Dauphin Isl, AL 36528 USA.\\nEM jkrause@disl.edu\\nOI Krause, Jeffrey/0000-0003-2479-6229\\nFU National Science Foundation Office of Polar Programs [OCE-1603605,\\n   OCE-1603460]; North Pacific Research Board [A91-99a, A91-00a,\\n   NA15NMF4720173]; Alaska Sikuliaq Program; ASGARD cruise [SKQ201708T,\\n   SKQ201709S]; North Pacific Research Board Arctic Integrated Ecosystem\\n   Research Program, NPRB [ArcticIERP-23]\\nFX Funding was provided by the National Science Foundation Office of Polar\\n   Programs (OCE-1603605, JWK; OCE-1603460; MWL) , logistic and vessel\\n   support by the North Pacific Research Board (A91-99a and A91-00a to SLD;\\n   NA15NMF4720173 to MWL, subaward to JWK) , andvessel support from the\\n   Alaska Sikuliaq Program (SLD) .

The model parameters and source conditions that are comparable to the vertical velocity and refractive index fluctuations measured 20 m above the Dante sulfide mound in the Main Endeavour vent Field are a heat transport of 50 MW over a cross-sectional area of 4 x 4.5 m(2). With these model source conditions and output results taken at 20 m above the source with 1 Hz sampling, the shear production of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), the vertical transport of TKE, and the buoyancy production/dissipation are quantified showing that shear production dominates. Similarly, thermal variance production, and its vertical transport, is also quantified showing that the advective term dominates. Because of enhanced entrainment of ambient water into the plume during strong crossflows, all mean and turbulent quantities show tidally modulated values. Assuming steady state, the dissipation rates are evaluated. During strong crossflows, the tilting of the vertical velocity contours and isotherms plays a critical role in the stability of the plume and in creating high shear and thermal gradients on the upstream side of the plume center axis. These dissipation rates are used to quantify the refractive index fluctuations, and given the high thermal dissipation quantity it is the main contributing factor in acoustic forward scatter.\\nC1 [Adams, Ian; Di Iorio, Daniela] Univ Georgia, Dept Marine Sci, Athens, GA 30602 USA.\\nRP Di Iorio, D (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Dept Marine Sci, Athens, GA 30602 USA.\\nEM daniela@uga.edu\\nFU NSF CAREER [OCE0449578]; NSF OTIC [OCE1334124]\\nFX This work was partially supported under the NSF CAREER grant OCE0449578\\n   and the NSF OTIC grant OCE1334124.

In 2010, the Gulf of Maine and Scotian Shelf regions of the Northwest Atlantic underwent an unprecedented regime shift. Forced by climate-driven changes in the Gulf Stream, warm slope waters entered the region and created a less favorable foraging environment for the endangered North Atlantic right whale population. By mid-decade, right whales had shifted their late spring/summer foraging grounds from the Gulf of Maine and the western Scotian Shelf to the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The population also began exhibiting unusually high mortality in 2017. Here, we report that climate-driven changes in ocean circulation have altered the foraging environment and habitat use of right whales, reducing the population\\'s calving rate and exposing it to greater mortality risks from ship strikes and fishing gear entanglement. The case of the North Atlantic right whale provides a cautionary tale for the management of protected species in a changing ocean.\\nC1 [Meyer-Gutbrod, Erin L.] Univ South Carolina, Sch Earth Ocean & Environm, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.\\n   [Greene, Charles H.] Cornell Univ, Ocean Resources & Ecosyst Program, Ithaca, NY USA.\\n   [Davies, Kimberley T.

The MC variability inferred from the Davao-Malakal sea level was predominantly biennial in the 1970s. This prevailing period switched to interannual in the 1980s and lengthened to decadal during the last two decades. With the aid of the basin-scale sea level information from satellite altimeter measurements, it is found that the sea level-inferred MC variability represents the coherent changes of the wind-driven tropical gyre in the western North Pacific. An investigation into the long-term wind stress curl data reveals that its prevailing period underwent similar biennial -> interannual -> decadal transitions in the western tropical Pacific, implying the forced nature of the period-lengthening of the MC variability during the past half-a-century. While the sign of the MC variability is largely determined by the Malakal sea level signals on the interannual and decadal time scales, the Davao sea level change becomes important when the time scale extends to multi-decades.\\n   Plain Language Summary Flowing southward along the Philippine coast from 13 degrees N to 5 degrees N, the Mindanao Current (MC) is a western boundary current and serves to close the wind-driven tropical gyre in the North Pacific Ocean. Climatically, the MC plays a critical role by transporting the mid-latitude North Pacific water equatorward with a portion of it entering the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean and contributing to the upper ocean heat budget in the cold-tongue region. The other portion of the MC permeates into the Eastern Indian Ocean via the Indonesian Throughflow and facilitates the water mass/ heat exchange between the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Despite its importance, observations of the MC transport have been rare and our understanding of its long-term variability is lacking. By utilizing the available tide gauge data at Davao and Malakal across the MC, we explored the MC transport variability of the past half-a-century. It is found that the timescale of the MC transport change has lengthened since 1969. While 2-year-period oscillations dominated in the 1970s, 4 similar to 6-year-period fluctuations took over during the 1980s, and the decadal variability became pre-dominant after 1990s. The cause behind these changes in timescale is due to the similar changes in the tropical Pacific surface wind system that ultimately drives the MC.\\nC1 [Chen, Xiao; Qi, Yiquan] Hohai Univ, Coll Oceanog, Nanjing, Peoples R China.\\n   [Chen, Xiao] Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab Zhuhai, Zhuhai, Peoples R China.\\n   [Qiu, Bo; Chen, Shuiming] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Oceanog, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.\\nRP Chen, X (通讯作者)，Hohai Univ, Coll Oceanog, Nanjing, Peoples R China.; Chen, X (通讯作者)，Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab Zhuhai, Zhuhai, Peoples R China.\\nEM chenxiao1231@hhu.edu.cn\\nFU National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFA0605703]; National Natural\\n   Science Foundation of China [41706004]; Natural Science Foundation of\\n   Jiangsu Province [BK20170872]\\nFX Constructive comments made by the two anonymous reviewer helped improve\\n   an early version of the manuscript.

This heat uptake is enhanced by a daily cycle of shear turbulence beneath the mixed layer-\"deep-cycle turbulence\"-that removes heat from the sea surface and deposits it in the upper flank of the Equatorial Undercurrent. Deep-cycle turbulence results when turbulence is triggered daily in sheared and stratified flow that is marginally stable (gradient Richardson number Ri approximate to 0.25). Deep-cycle turbulence has been observed on numerous occasions in the cold tongue at 0 degrees, 140 degrees W, and may be modulated by tropical instability waves (TIWs). Here we use a primitive equation regional simulation of the cold tongue to show that deep-cycle turbulence may also occur off the equator within TIW cold cusps where the flow is marginally stable. In the cold cusp, preexisting equatorial zonal shear u(z) is enhanced by horizontal vortex stretching near the equator, and subsequently modified by horizontal vortex tilting terms to generate meridional shear upsilon (z) off of the equator. Parameterized turbulence in the sheared flow of the cold cusp is triggered daily by the descent of the surface mixing layer associated with the weakening of the stabilizing surface buoyancy flux in the afternoon. Observational evidence for off-equatorial deep-cycle turbulence is restricted to a few CTD casts, which, when combined with shear from shipboard ADCP data, suggest the presence of marginally stable flow in TIW cold cusps. This study motivates further observational campaigns to characterize the modulation of deep-cycle turbulence by TIWs both on and off the equator.\\nC1 [Cherian, D. A.; Whitt, D. B.; Bachman, S.

Our focus is on the relative role of local wind forcing and remote forcing from the equatorial Pacific Ocean. We use satellite altimetry measurements, an atmospheric reanalysis, and a one-dimensional wave model tuned to simulate observed SSH anomalies. The model solution is decomposed into the part driven by local winds and that driven by SSH variability radiated from the western coast of Australia. Results show that variability radiated from the Australian coast is larger in amplitude than variability driven by local winds in the central and eastern parts of the south Indian Ocean at midlatitudes (between 19 degrees and 33 degrees S), whereas the influence from eastern boundary forcing is confined to the eastern basin at lower latitudes (10 degrees and 17 degrees S). The relative importance of eastern boundary forcing at midlatitudes is due to the weakness of wind stress curl anomalies in the interior of the south Indian Ocean. Our analysis further suggests that SSH variability along the west coast of Australia originates from remote wind forcing in the tropical Pacific, as is pointed out by previous studies. The zonal gradient of SSH between the western and eastern parts of the south Indian Ocean is also mostly controlled by variability radiated from the Australian coast, indicating that interannual variability in meridional geostrophic transport is driven principally by Pacific winds. Significance StatementA complete understanding of climate variability and change requires knowledge of the interactions between ocean basins on interannual to decadal time scales. In this study, we examined the cause of sea level variability in the south Indian Ocean and its connection with variability in the Pacific Ocean, using satellite observations and a one-dimensional wave model. We found that sea level variability at midlatitudes of the south Indian Ocean is mainly driven by El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Surface wind anomalies associated with ENSO excite sea level variations in the Pacific Ocean, which propagates into the western coast of Australia through the Indonesian Archipelago and then into the interior of the south Indian Ocean. This study emphasizes the importance of connectivity via the oceanic route to understand midlatitude circulation variability in the south Indian Ocean.\\nC1 [Nagura, Motoki] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan.\\n   [McPhaden, Michael J.] NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, 7600 Sand Point Way Ne, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.\\nRP Nagura, M (通讯作者)，Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan.\\nEM nagura@jamstec.go.jp\\nOI Nagura, Motoki/0000-0002-0594-4823\\nFU JSPS [JP18K03750]\\nFX We thank Denis Volkov for constructive comments on the original version\\n   of this manuscript.

These modified waters will eventually subduct near the polar front and enter the global overturning circulation. Submesoscale processes modulate the stratification of the mixed layer (ML) and ML properties. Sparse observations in polar regions mean that the role of submesoscale motions in the exchange of properties across the base of the ML is not well understood. The goal of this study is to determine the interplay between sea-ice melt, surface boundary layer forcing, and submesoscale flows in setting properties of the surface ML in the Antarctic marginal ice zone. High-resolution observations suggest that fine-scale lateral fronts arise from either/both mesoscale and submesoscale stirring of sea-ice meltwater anomalies. The strong salinity-driven stratification at the base of the ML confines these fronts to the upper ocean, limiting submesoscale vertical fluxes across the ML base. This strong stratification prevents the local subduction of modified waters by submesoscale flows, suggesting that the subduction site that links to the global overturning circulation does not correspond with the location of sea-ice melt. However, surface-enhanced fronts increase the potential for Ekman-driven cross-frontal flow to modulate the stability of the ML and ML properties. The parameterization of submesoscale processes in coupled-climate models, particularly those contributing to the Ekman buoyancy flux, may improve the representation of ML heat and freshwater transport in the ice-impacted Southern Ocean during summer.\\nC1 [Giddy, I; Swart, S.] Univ Cape Town, Dept Oceanog, Rondebosch, South Africa.\\n   [Giddy, I; Swart, S.; du Plessis, M.] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Marine Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden.\\n   [Giddy, I; du Plessis, M.; Nicholson, S-A] CSIR, Southern Ocean Carbon Climate Observ, Cape Town, South Africa.\\n   [Thompson, A.

Cohorts were identified using a Gaussian mixture model and tracked over time from the juvenile stage through adulthood. Initial size mode at the juvenile stage was typically 4-5 mm and final size modes ranged from 12 to 18 mm. In total, 28 cohorts were identified, of which 22 appear to be complete cohorts that were tracked from start to finish during the 11-year study period. Of these 22 cohorts, 19 were tracked for <= 1.5 years. The three cohorts tracked for >2 years grew more slowly than other cohorts, though their final size modes were similar. These three cohorts were associated with delayed upwelling and moderate chlorophyll concentrations, suggesting that their extended duration and slower growth were related to suboptimal environmental conditions. Growth rates calculated from cohort size modes decreased overall as animals reached adult size. Cohort analysis captured some instances of negative growth, particularly after animals reached a total length of 10 mm, similar to instantaneous growth rates (IGR) measured in a previous study. Survivorship curves were created from eggs and larvae for each year from 2001 to 2005. Survivorship was similar among years except in 2005 when upwelling and subsequent spawning were delayed by one month. Based on the survivorship curves, the E. pacifica juvenile stage lasts an average of six months and the total life span in the study area is approximately two years. Successful identification and tracking of cohorts suggests that euphausiids at station NH25 are representative of the overall population dynamics of Euphausia pacifica in the shelf-break region off the Oregon Coast.\\nC1 [Shaw, C.

The interaction between currents and waves can lead to variations in the wave direction, frequency, and amplitude. In the present work, we use an ensemble of synthetic currents to force the wave model WAVEWATCH III and assess the relative impact of current divergence and vorticity in modifying several properties of the waves, including direction, period, directional spreading, and significant wave height H-s. We find that the spatial variability of H-s is highly sensitive to the nature of the underlying current and that refraction is the main mechanism leading to gradients of H-s. The results obtained using synthetic currents were used to interpret the response of surface waves to realistic currents by running an additional set of simulations using the llc4320 MITgcm output in the California Current region. Our findings suggest that wave parameters could be used to detect and characterize strong gradients in the velocity field, which is particularly relevant for the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite as well as several proposed satellite missions.\\nC1 [Boas, Ana B.

The gravitational potential induced by tidal mass redistribution is routinely modeled for global gravity analysis and orbit determination, although generally by assuming a spherical Earth and a uniform seawater density. The inadequacy of these simplifications is here addressed. We have developed an accurate yet efficient algorithm to compute the ocean tidal geopotential, allowing for Earth\\'s elliptical shape and variable seawater density. Using this new computation, we find that (1) the effect of ellipticity is several percent of the tide signal over mid to high-latitude regions, which is comparable to elevation error in the state-of-the-art ocean tide models; (2) the effect of seawater density variations on the potential is as large as 2-3 cm in water-height equivalent, primarily in deep water where density increases 2%-3% from compressibility. Our analysis of new Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Follow-On (GRACE-FO) laser ranging interferometer measurements reveals evident errors when ellipticity and density variations are ignored. When accounted for, the GRACE-FO residual tidal gravity perturbations are reduced by half, depending on the adopted tide model; only the remaining half likely represents actual model elevation error. The use of a spherical surface and a uniform seawater density is no longer tenable given the precision of gravity measurements from GRACE and GRACE-FO satellites.\\nC1 [Han, Shin-Chan; Ghobadi-Far, Khosro] Univ Newcastle, Sch Engn, Callaghan, NSW, Australia.\\n   [Ray, Richard D.] NASA, Geodesy & Geophys Lab, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD USA.\\n   [Papanikolaou, Thomas] Geosci Australia, Canberra, ACT, Australia.\\nRP Han, SC (通讯作者)，Univ Newcastle, Sch Engn, Callaghan, NSW, Australia.\\nEM shin-chan.han@newcastle.edu.au\\nRI Papanikolaou, Thomas/AAY-6767-2020\\nOI Papanikolaou, Thomas/0000-0001-7127-0428; Ghobadi-Far,\\n   Khosro/0000-0001-8146-252X; Han, Shin-Chan/0000-0003-1810-1670\\nFU University of Newcastle; Australian Research Council [DP170100224]; US\\n   National Aeronautics and Space Administration (GRACE Science Team)\\nFX This work was funded by the University of Newcastle to support NASA\\'s\\n   GRACE and GRACE Follow-On projects as an international science team\\n   member to the missions, by Australian Research Council Discovery Program\\n   (DP170100224), and by the US National Aeronautics and Space\\n   Administration (GRACE Science Team).

Variations in sea ice mass balance reflect these changes and give insight to the environmental forcings which caused them. In this work, the time series results from eight Lagrangian mass balance sites that operated in the Beaufort Sea over the years 1997-2015 are analyzed. Direct measurements from the sites are combined with estimates of ice/ocean heat input to examine the roll of solar heating on ice loss, growth, and melt rates. Comparisons between ice and snow conditions and mass balance event timing, for example, surface and bottom melt onset, melt peak, and melt end, are also made. From the late 1990s to the present, a general increase in bottom melting and solar heat input to the upper ocean was observed. All sites showed a net loss of ice (ranging from 29 to 271 cm), and all but one site saw the majority of this loss from bottom melting. Bottom melt onset occurred within a relatively narrow 13-day window between 1 and 13 June at all sites. The amount of observed bottom melt was also related to the heat deposited in the ocean available for melting, underscoring the increasingly important role of ocean thermodynamics in determining sea ice mass balance.\\nC1 [Planck, Cameron J.; Perovich, Donald K.] Dartmouth Coll, Thayer Sch Engn, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.\\n   [Light, Bonnie] Univ Washington, Appl Phys Lab, Polar Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.\\nRP Planck, CJ (通讯作者)，Dartmouth Coll, Thayer Sch Engn, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.\\nEM cameron.j.planck.th@dartmouth.edu\\nOI Light, Bonnie/0000-0003-2640-5738; Planck, Cameron/0000-0003-4384-4740;\\n   Perovich, Don/0000-0002-0576-0864\\nNR 49\\nTC 2\\nZ9 2\\nU1 1\\nU2 3\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

Krill have a high lipid content compared to other zooplankton and form dense aggregations, making them an important prey source for higher trophic level fish, seabirds, and marine mammals. The two dominant euphausiid species in the northern California Current (NCC) are Euphausia pacifica and Thysanoessa spinifera. E. pacifica is the most abundant species of euphausiid in the NCC, but T. spinifera has a higher potential energetic content due to its larger body size and higher lipid density. Most studies have inferred differences in lipid content and body condition between the two species, but few studies have quantified these differences in the NCC. Here, we report on the body condition, carbon and nitrogen content, as well as lipid and fatty acid composition of these two krill species, and the extent to which these metrics vary across season, year, and reproductive status. Body condition, elemental composition, and total lipids strongly differed between the species. T. spinifera had higher length-weight, Fulton\\'s K, hepato-somatic index, carbon to nitrogen ratio, total lipid per wet weight, and storage lipid compared to E. pacifica, indicating that T. spinifera has a higher energetic value for predators. However, there were strong seasonal differences in the energetics of T. spinifera. Carbon and lipids were highest in non-reproductive T. spinifera from August through October. Although there were strong ontogenetic and inter-specific differences, the lipid and fatty acid compositions of both species followed a seasonal progression characterized by low lipids during the pre-upwelling period, an increase in lipids, triacylglycerols, and diatom markers during upwelling, and increased proportions of dinoflagellate and bacterial diet markers during the fall post-upwelling period.\\nC1 [Fisher, Jennifer L.; Menkel, Jennifer; Copeman, Louise; Shaw, C.

We evaluated megafaunal food web structure and nutritional sources in the Kermadec and Mariana trenches using carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis (delta N-15 and delta C-13 values) of bulk tissues and proteinaceous individual amino acids (AAs). In the Kermadec Trench, bulk delta N-15 values ranged from 5.8 parts per thousand in trench sediment to 17.5 parts per thousand in tissues of the supergiant amphipod, Allicela gigantea. delta N-15 values of detritivores were much higher than those of sediments (by 7.5 parts per thousand more). The delta C-13 values ranged from -21.4 parts per thousand in sediments to -17.3 parts per thousand in the brittle star, Ophiolimna sp., and did not co-vary with delta N-15 values. In the Mariana Trench, only bait-attending fauna and surface sediments were available for analysis. Mariana Trench fishes, amphipods, and sediments had slightly lower delta N-15 values than those from the Kermadec Trench, possibly because the Mariana Trench lies under more oligotrophic surface waters. We found evidence for multiple food inputs to the system in each trench, namely substantially higher delta C-13 values in detritivores relative to sediment and high variability in delta C-13 values. Trophic levels determined from isotopic analysis of individual AAs in the Kermadec Trench ranged from three for detritivores to five for fishes. Source AA delta C-13 values were variable (range of -7.0 parts per thousand in average delta N-15 source AA values), with much of this variation occurring in small amphipods. For the other fauna sampled, there was a significant increase in delta N-15 source AA values with increasing collection depth. This increase could reflect larger amounts of highly micmbially reworked organic matter with increasing depth or sporadic input from turbidity flows. Although further sampling across a broader faunal diversity will be required to understand these food webs, our results provide new insights into hadal trophic interactions and suggest that trench food webs are very dynamic.\\nC1 [Tokuda, Andrew K.; Drazen, Jeffrey C.; Popp, Brian N.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.\\n   [Gerringer, Mackenzie E.] SUNY Coll Geneseo, Geneseo, NY 14454 USA.\\n   [Grammatopoulou, Eleanna] Univ Aberdeen, Aberdeen, Scotland.\\n   [Mayor, Daniel J.] Natl Oceanog Ctr, Southampton, Hants, England.\\nRP Drazen, JC (通讯作者)，Univ Hawaii Manoa, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.\\nEM jdrazen@hawaii.edu\\nRI ; Drazen, Jeffrey/C-1197-2013\\nOI Mayor, Daniel/0000-0002-1295-0041; Drazen, Jeffrey/0000-0001-9613-3833;\\n   Popp, Brian/0000-0001-7021-5478\\nFU National Science Foundation (OCE) [1130712]; Schmidt Ocean Institute\\n   [FK141109]; Natural Environment Research Council, UK; Undergraduate\\n   Research Opportunities Program (UROP) at UH Manoa, HI, United States;\\n   National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship; SUNY Geneseo;\\n   NERC [noc010009] Funding Source: UKRI\\nFX We thank the captains and crews of the RVs Thompson and Falkor as well\\n   as the HROV Nereus team.

The TIW-induced surface velocity has not been accurately estimated in previous diagnostic models, especially for the meridional component across the equator. This study develops a diagnostic model that retains the acceleration terms to estimate the TIW surface velocity from the satellite-observed sea surface height. Validated against moored observations, the velocity across the equator is accurately estimated for the first time, much improved from existing products. The results identify the Rossby- and Yanai-mode TIWs as the northwest-southeastward (NW-SE) velocity oscillations north of the equator and the northeast-southwestward (NE-SW) velocity oscillations on the equator, respectively. Barotropic instability is the dominant energy source of the two TIW modes. The NE-SW velocity oscillation of the Yanai mode is associated with the counterclockwise shear of the South Equatorial Current on the equator. The two TIW modes induce different sea surface temperature patterns and vertical motions. Accurate estimates of TIW velocity are important for studying equatorial ocean dynamics and climate variability in the tropical Pacific Ocean.\\nC1 [Wang, Minyang; Du, Yan] Chinese Acad Sci, South China Sea Inst Oceanol, State Key Lab Trop Oceanog, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.\\n   [Wang, Minyang; Du, Yan] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.\\n   [Wang, Minyang; Xie, Shang-Ping; Shen, Samuel S.

The derived ecosystem indices were classified into three categories: (1) direct indices, like the trophic level of species, influenced by stomach sample size directly; (2) indirect indices, like ecology efficiency (EE) of invertebrates, influenced by the multiple prey-predator relationships; and (3) systemic indices, like total system throughout (TST), describing the status of the whole ecosystem. The influences of different stomach sample sizes on these indices were evaluated. The results suggest that systemic indices of the ecosystem model were robust to stomach sample sizes, whereas specific indices related to species were indicated to be with low accuracy and precision when stomach samples were insufficient.

Satellite-measured normalized waterleaving radiance spectra nL(w)(lambda) are found to be similar with the peak at the 671 nm red band in the inner and mid estuaries, while nL(w)(lambda)) spectra peak at the 551 nm green band in the outer estuary. Remarkable seasonal and inter-annual variability are also observed in the La Plata River Estuary. The austral autumn (March-May) is found to be the most turbid season. An enhanced radiance ratio nL(w)(745)/nL(w)(671) is also found to occur during the austral autumn season in the inner and mid estuaries. The La Plata River Estuary had the most turbid water in 2012 in terms of the satellite-measured water diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm K-d (490) in the inner and mid estuaries. The low K-d (490) in the inner and mid estuaries during 2015-2016 coincided with the strong 2015-2016 El Nino event. The first and second empirical orthogonal function (EOF) modes account for about 34.9% and 27.0% of the total K-d (490) variance in the La Plata River Estuary, respectively. In addition, the K-d (490) variation in the inner and mid estuaries is out of phase with that in the outer estuary. The winds, rainfall, and river discharge are attributed to the first and second EOF modes of the K-d(490) in the La Plata River Estuary.\\nC1 [Shi, Wei; Wang, Menghua] NOAA, Natl Environm Satellite Data & Informat Serv, Ctr Satellite Applicat & Res, E-RA3, College Pk, MD 20740 USA.\\n   [Shi, Wei] Colorado State Univ, CIRA, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.\\nRP Shi, W (通讯作者)，NOAA, Natl Environm Satellite Data & Informat Serv, Ctr Satellite Applicat & Res, E-RA3, College Pk, MD 20740 USA.\\nEM wei.1.shi@noaa.gov\\nRI Wang, Menghua/F-5631-2010\\nOI Wang, Menghua/0000-0001-7019-3125\\nFU Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS)\\nFX This research was supported by the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS)\\n   funding.

(2018, ) wave-breaking onset prediction framework for surface gravity water waves in arbitrary water depth, including shallow water breaking over varying bathymetry. We show that the Barthelemy et al. (2018) breaking onset criterion, which they validated for deep and intermediate water depths, also segregates breaking crests from nonbreaking crests in shallow water, with subsequent breaking always following the exceedance of their proposed generic breaking threshold. We consider a number of representative wave types, including regular, irregular, solitary, and focused waves, shoaling over idealized bed topographies including an idealized bar geometry and a mildly to steeply sloping planar beach. Our results show that the new breaking onset criterion is capable of detecting single and multiple breaking events in time and space in arbitrary water depth. Further, we show that the new generic criterion provides improved skill for signaling imminent breaking onset, relative to the available kinematic or geometric breaking onset criteria in the literature. In particular, the new criterion is suitable for use in wave-resolving models that cannot intrinsically detect the onset of wave breaking.\\nC1 [Derakhti, Morteza; Thomson, Jim] Univ Washington, Appl Phys Lab, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.\\n   [Kirby, James T.] Univ Delaware, Ctr Appl Coastal Res, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Newark, DE USA.\\n   [Banner, Michael L.] Univ New South Wales, Sch Math & Stat, Sydney, NSW, Australia.\\n   [Grilli, Stephan T.] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Ocean Engn, Narragansett, RI USA.\\nRP Derakhti, M (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Appl Phys Lab, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.\\nEM derakhti@uw.edu\\nRI Kirby, James T/AAF-7253-2020; Thomson, Jim/C-7610-2012; ,\\n   Stephan/L-8737-2014\\nOI Thomson, Jim/0000-0002-8929-0088; , Stephan/0000-0001-8615-4585;\\n   Derakhti, Morteza/0000-0002-9176-1264; Kirby, James/0000-0001-6978-899X;\\n   Banner, Michael/0000-0002-0799-5341\\nFU NSF Physical Oceanography [OCE-1756040, OCE-1756355]; Australian\\n   Research Council [ARC DP120101701]; U.S. Office of Naval Research\\n   [N00014-16-1270]\\nFX This work was supported by NSF Physical Oceanography Grants OCE-1756040\\n   and OCE-1756355 to the Universities ofWashington and Delaware.\\n   Computational support was provided by UD Instructional Technologies.

The two most recent observational programs in Drake Passage, DRAKE and cDrake, yielded transports of 141 and 173.3 Sv, respectively. In this paper, we use a realistic 1/12 degrees global ocean simulation to interpret these observational estimates and reconcile their differences. We first show that the modeled ACC transport in the upper 1,000 m is in excellent agreement with repeat shipboard acoustic Doppler current profiler (SADCP) transects and that the exponentially decaying transport profile in the model is consistent with the profile derived from repeat hydrographic data. By further comparing the model results to the cDrake and DRAKE observations, we argue that the modeled 157.3 Sv transport, that is, approximately the average of the cDrake and DRAKE estimates, is actually representative of the time-mean ACC transport through the Drake Passage. The cDrake experiment overestimated the barotropic contribution in part because the array undersampled the deep recirculation southwest of the Shackleton Fracture Zone, whereas the surface geostrophic currents used in the DRAKE estimate yielded a weaker near-surface transport than implied by the SADCP data. We also find that the modeled baroclinic and barotropic transports are not correlated; thus, monitoring either baroclinic or barotropic transport alone may be insufficient to assess the temporal variability of the total ACC transport.\\nC1 [Xu, Xiaobiao; Chassignet, Eric P.] Florida State Univ, Ctr Ocean Atmospher Predict Studies, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.\\n   [Firing, Yvonne L.] Natl Oceanog Ctr, Southampton, Hants, England.\\n   [Donohue, Kathleen] Univ Rhode Isl, Grad Sch Oceanog, Narragansett, RI 02882 USA.\\nRP Xu, XB (通讯作者)，Florida State Univ, Ctr Ocean Atmospher Predict Studies, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.\\nEM xxu3@fsu.edu\\nOI Firing, Yvonne/0000-0002-3640-3974; Xu, Xiaobiao/0000-0001-8902-7645\\nFU U.S. National Science Foundation Physical Oceanography Program\\n   [1537136]; Office of Naval Research [N00014-19-12717]; U.K. Natural\\n   Environment Research Council [NE/N018095/1]; NERC [NE/N018095/1] Funding\\n   Source: UKRI\\nFX X.X. and E.P.C. are supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation\\n   Physical Oceanography Program (award 1537136) and by the Office of Naval\\n   Research (N00014-19-12717).

The shape of the particle size distribution (PSD) is commonly modeled as a single-slope power law in oceanographic studies, which can be used to further estimate the relative contributions of different particle size classes to particle number, area, and volume concentration. We use a data set of 168 high size-resolution PSD measurements in Arctic oceanic waters to examine variability in the shape of the PSD over the particle diameter range 0.8 to 120 mu m. An average value of -3.6 +/- 0.33 was obtained for the slope of a power law fitted over this size range, consistent with other studies. Our analysis indicates, however, that this model has significant limitations in adequately parameterizing the complexity of the PSD, and thus performs poorly in predicting the relative contributions of different size intervals such as those based on picoplankton, nanoplankton, and microplankton size classes. Similarly, median particle size was also generally a poor indicator of these size class contributions. Our results suggest that alternative percentile diameters derived from the cumulative distribution functions of particle number, cross-sectional area, and volume concentration may provide better metrics to capture the overall shape of the PSD and to quantify the contributions of different particle size classes.\\nC1 [Runyan, Hugh; Reynolds, Rick A.; Stramski, Dariusz] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Marine Phys Lab, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.\\nRP Reynolds, RA (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Marine Phys Lab, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.\\nEM rreynolds@ucsd.edu\\nRI Reynolds, Rick A/C-7470-2014\\nOI Reynolds, Rick A/0000-0002-1579-3600; Runyan, Hugh/0000-0002-6020-0245\\nFU National Aeronautics and Space Administration [NNX07AR20G, NNX10AG05G];\\n   National Science Foundation [OPP-1822021]; Japan Aerospace Exploration\\n   Agency [GCOM-C 311]\\nFX We thank Marcel Babin, Kevin Arrigo, Shigeto Nishino, Toru Hirawake, and\\n   all cruise participants for assistance in the field.

Numerical experiments were conducted for the recent anomalously cold (2014-2015) and warm (2015-2016) winters that were accompanied by high and low ice coverage over the lakes, respectively. The results of numerical experiments showed that snow cover on the ice, which is the manifestation of winter precipitation, reduced the total ice volume (or mean ice thickness) in all of the Great Lakes, shortened the ice duration, and allowed earlier warming of water surface. The reduced ice volume was due to the thermal insulation of snow cover. The surface albedo was also increased by snow cover, but its impact on the delay the melting of ice was overcome by the thermal insulation effect. During major snowstorms, snowfall over the open lake caused notable cooling of the water surface due to latent heat absorption. Overall, the sensible heat flux from rain in spring and summer was found to have negligible impacts on the water surface temperature. Although uncertainties remain in overlake precipitation estimates and model\\'s representation of snow on the ice, this study demonstrated that winter precipitation, particularly snowfall on the ice and water surfaces, is an important contributing factor in Great Lakes ice production and thermal conditions from late fall to spring.\\n   Plain Language Summary Snow and rain impact on ice cover and water temperature in large lakes were studied using a computational model for an example of the Laurentian Great Lakes. It was found that snow cover increased the reflection of solar radiation but at the same time prevented lake ice from the growing, resulting in less formation of ice and slightly earlier melting. The earlier ice melting also allowed earlier warming of the water surface in spring. Major snowstorms caused slight cooling in the water surface temperature because snowflakes absorbed heat when it touched the water surface to melt. On the other hand, warmer rain barely changed the water surface temperature during summer.\\n   Key Points\\n   Precipitation impacts on Great Lakes ice cover and water temperature were evaluated using a coupled ice-hydrodynamic model The model results showed that snow cover on the ice reduced the net production of ice, which resulted in earlier decay of ice cover The model results showed that snowfall cooled the water surface notably through latent heat absorption during storms\\nC1 [Fujisaki-Manome, A.] Univ Michigan, Cooperat Inst Great Lakes Res, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.\\n   [Fujisaki-Manome, A.] Univ Michigan, Climate & Space Sci & Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.\\n   [Anderson, E.

This water mass transformation is contingent upon a relative low rate of FRIS basal melt, currently around 100-200Gt/yr. Previous studies have indicated that Antarctic climate changes may induce intrusions of warm modified Warm Deep Water (mWDW) and an order-of-magnitude increase in basal melt, and signatures of mWDW have recently been observed along the face of the FRIS. However, it remains unclear how changes in near-Antarctic climate translate mechanistically to changes in mWDW access to the FRIS cavity. In this study a regional model is developed to investigate FRIS circulation dependence on local atmospheric state. Experiments with modified initial cavity conditions but identical atmospheric states yield bistable \"warm\" and \"cold\" FRIS cavity states, with an order-of-magnitude difference in basal melt rates. Idealized atmospheric perturbation experiments reveal that relatively modest perturbations to the katabatic winds shift the FRIS cavity between \"warm\" and \"cold\" states, which occur when the FRIS cavity is filled by mWDW or High Salinity Shelf Water (HSSW), respectively. The authors present a conceptual model in which the FRIS cavity state is determined by whether mWDW or HSSW is denser and thus floods the cavity; these states are bistable because the basal melt rate feeds back on the salinity of HSSW. These findings highlight a key role for the katabatic winds in mediating the melt of the FRIS and other Antarctic ice shelves.\\n   Plain Language Summary The Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf (FRIS) is Antarctica\\'s largest floating glacier and is the source of the ocean\\'s densest waters. Previous studies have predicted that warmer waters from offshore may flow beneath the FRIS in the future, elevating its melt rate and suppressing formation of dense waters. In this study, the controls on this warm water inflow are investigated using simulations of the southern Weddell Sea (WS), imposing various perturbations to the atmospheric winds and temperature. The ocean beneath the FRIS is found to be \"bistable\": Depending on its initial conditions, the ocean beneath the FRIS adjusts either to a \"cold\" state in which it is filled by waters originating from the WS continental shelf or to a \"warm\" state in which it is filled by waters originating from offshore. A switch between warm and cold states can be forced by changing the winds that blow northward over the FRIS; together with FRIS meltwater, these winds influence the density of cold waters formed on the WS continental shelf. These findings highlight a key role for offshore winds in mediating the melt of the FRIS and indicate that existing dense waters beneath ice shelves may buffer against future intrusions of warm water.\\nC1 [Hazel, Julia E.; Stewart, Andrew L.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.\\nRP Hazel, JE (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.\\nEM jhazel@atmos.ucla.edu\\nOI Stewart, Andrew/0000-0001-5861-4070\\nFU National Science Foundation (NSF) [ANT-1543388, OCE-1751386]; National\\n   Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) ROSES Physical Oceanography\\n   program [80NSSC19K1192]; NSF [ACI-1548562]\\nFX All new data presented in this study are output from model simulations\\n   using the publicly available Massachusetts Institute of Technology\\n   general circulation model (MITgcm), which is available online (via\\n   https://mitgcm.org/).Matlab scripts used to generate, run, and analyze\\n   these simulations are available online (via\\n   https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3529796).This material is based in part\\n   upon work supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under\\n   Grants ANT-1543388 and OCE-1751386 and by the National Aeronautics and\\n   Space Administration (NASA) ROSES Physical Oceanography program under\\n   Grant 80NSSC19K1192.

It is found that subduction occur in winter, and it was greatly weakened by similar to 58% due to the summer monsoon. Furthermore, there is a second obduction window opened up during the summer monsoon period, besides the winter obduction window.\\n   The winter subduction is concentrated in two narrow regions: one is located in the northern SCS and the other in the eastern SCS from 10 degrees N to 15 degrees N. The winter obduction distributes widely in two areas: the northeastern SCS and the area south of 10 degrees N, while the summer obduction occurs primarily near the Vietnam. The key factors regulating subduction/obduction and their variability at different areas are different: the lateral induction term is the key contributor for subduction in the northern SCS; however, for the subduction in the eastern SCS and the obduction process, the vertical pumping term is dominant. Furthermore, the subducted (obducted) water in the SCS would penetrate into (come from) the subsurface ocean at the depth similar to 100m after (before) one year.\\nC1 [Liu, Ling Ling; Wang, Fan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, CAS Key Lab Ocean Circulat & Waves, Qingdao, Peoples R China.\\n   [Huang, Rui Xin] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Trop Oceanog, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.\\n   [Liu, Ling Ling; Wang, Fan] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Ocean Megasci, Qingdao, Peoples R China.\\n   [Liu, Ling Ling; Wang, Fan] Pilot Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol Qingdao, Qingdao, Peoples R China.\\n   [Huang, Rui Xin] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Phys Oceanog, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\nRP Liu, LL (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, 7 Rd Nanhai, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China.\\nEM liull@qdio.ac.cn\\nRI Wang, Fan/J-5119-2012\\nOI Wang, Fan/0000-0001-5932-7567\\nFU National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC1404002];\\n   National Natural Science Foundation of China [41976009]; National\\n   Programme on Global Change and Air-Sea Interaction [GASI-IPOVAI-04]\\nFX This work is supported by the National Key Research and Development\\n   Program of China under grant 2017YFC1404002, National Natural Science\\n   Foundation of China under Grant 41976009, the National Programme on\\n   Global Change and Air-Sea Interaction (GASI-IPOVAI-04).

These first-reported turbulence measurements in Bering Strait show that dissipation rates here are high even during calm winds. High turbulence in the strait has important implications for the modification of water properties during transit from the Pacific Ocean to the Arctic Ocean. Measured diffusivities averaging 2 x 10(-2) m(2) s(-1) are capable of causing watermass property changes of 0.1 degrees C and 0.1 psu during the similar to 1-2-day transit through the narrowest part of the strait. We estimate friction velocity using both the dissipation and profile methods and find a bottom drag coefficient of 2.3 (+/- 0.4) x 10(-3). This result is smaller than values typically used to estimate bottom stress in the region and may improve predictions of transport variability through Bering Strait.\\nC1 [Couto, Nicole; Alford, Matthew H.; MacKinnon, Jennifer] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.\\n   [Mickett, John B.] Univ Washington, Appl Phys Lab, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.\\nRP Couto, N (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.\\nEM ncouto@ucsd.edu\\nFU NSF [PLR-1303791]; ONR [N00014-12-1-0917]\\nFX This work was supported by NSF Award PLR-1303791 and ONR Award\\n   N00014-12-1-0917.

We examine the density, biomass, respiration, and species richness size spectra of polychaetes from a time-series study (1991-2011) in the abyssal NE Pacific (Station M, 35 degrees N, 123 degrees W, 4000 m water depth). The spectra met the predictions of the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) and were consistent with Damuth\\'s rule of energetic equivalence. When combined via MTE, resource supply rate and habitat temperature have valuable predictive power for seafloor standing stocks. Intra-annual comparisons suggested seasonally variable resource acquisition rates and metabolism, consistent with the scope for specific dynamic action in polychaetes. Accepting and applying the assumptions of MTE, Damuth\\'s rule, and 3/4-power mass-scaling of metabolism to the entire benthos, then two thirds of carbon remineralised at the seafloor might be attributable to metazoan invertebrates. This is contrary to the common finding of microbial dominance but may be resolved by considering (1) that only a fraction of microbial biomass may be metabolically active, and (2) that the metabolism of the largest members of the benthos could only be assessed at physical scales very much greater than are usually examined.\\nC1 [Marchais, Claire Laguionie] Univ Southampton, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England.\\n   [Bett, Brian J.; Ruhl, Henry A.] Natl Oceanog Ctr, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England.\\n   [Paterson, Gordon L.

Despite decades of research, predicting the variability of POM to the deep ocean remains difficult as there is still a gap in the knowledge as to which and how organisms control or influence POM export. Here, we used DNA meta-barcoding of the 16S and 18S rRNA genes to investigate the community in sinking particulates collected over 9-months (November 2016-July 2017) at Station M, located within the California Current ecosystem. Particle-associated communities were collected in sediment traps (3900 m and 3950 m), in aggregates that settled on the sea floor (4000 m), and in seawater from the overlying water column. For a majority of the deployment, particulate organic carbon (POC) fluxes were within the Station M long-term time series mean +/- sigma (8.3 + 7.9 mg C m(-2) d(-1)). In late June, a high flux event (>long-term POC mean +/- 2 sigma) was captured, accounting for 44% of the POC collected during the study. The rRNA genes within the sinking particles indicated highly variable eukaryal communities over time, including the export of oligotrophic autotrophs likely by various metazoan taxa during winter, the sporadic and dominant presence of diverse radiolarian orders, and the important role of coastal diatoms during seasonal increases in POC flux. Specifically, the onset of the high POC flux event in June was attributed to the export of a single coastal diatom species. A coincident increase in the relative abundance of metazoan sequences suggests that zooplankton grazing on the diatom community played a role in rapid transport of large quantities of POC to the deep sea. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene community supported the presence of highly processed POM during winter due to the high relative abundance of deep sea Gammaproteobacteria, that transitioned to fresher, more labile POM with the arrival of a diatom bloom community. These observations support long standing paradigms of particulate export to the deep sea, including its origin and mechanisms of export mediated by a diverse community of organisms, and implicate rapidly exported diatom blooms as at least one source of the increasingly frequent episodic flux events that account for most POC sequestered in the deep ocean at Station M.\\nC1 [Preston, Christina M.; Yamahara, Kevan M.] Monterey Bay Aquarium Res Inst, 7700 Sandholdt Rd, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA.\\n   [Durkin, Colleen A.] Moss Landing Marine Labs, 8272 Moss Landing Rd, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA.\\nRP Preston, CM (通讯作者)，Monterey Bay Aquarium Res Inst, 7700 Sandholdt Rd, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA.\\nEM preston@mbari.org\\nFU David and Lucille Packard Foundation; California Sea Grant [R/HCME-37]\\nFX We thank Ken Smith Jr. and Christina Huffard for providing the POC data,\\n   ROVER data, and collecting sediment trap and water column samples used\\n   in this study.

The Kerguelen Plateau (KP) region in the Indian sector of the SO is a hot spot for these energetic dynamics, which result in large spatiotemporal variability of physical and biogeochemical properties throughout the water column. Data from Argo floats (including biogeochemical) are used to investigate the spatial variability of intermediate and deep water physical and biogeochemical properties. An unsupervised machine learning classification approach is used to organize the float profiles into five SO frontal zones based on their temperature and salinity structure between 300 and 900 m, revealing not only the location of frontal zones and their boundaries but also the variability of water mass properties relative to the zonal mean state. We find that the variability is property dependent and can be more than twice as large as the mean zonal variability in intense eddy fields. In particular, we observe this intense variability in the intermediate and deep waters of the Subtropical Zone; in the Subantarctic Zone just west of and at KP; east of KP in the Polar Frontal Zone, associated with intense eddy variability that enhances deep waters convergence and mixing; and, as the deep waters upwell to the upper 500 m and mix with the surface waters in the southernmost regimes, each property shows a large variability.\\n   Plain Language Summary The Southern Ocean strongly influences the global climate system, by absorbing, storing, and redistributing heat and carbon across the different ocean basins. Thanks to an increasing number of observations from autonomous instruments, called Argo floats, our understanding of this harsh environment has deepened in the last two decades. Here we use a machine learning technique to automatically classify the float measurements and sort them in regimes with similar properties based on their temperature and salinity vertical structure. The classification results are consistent with previous studies but are here used to reveal regions where mixing between different types of waters is likely to be occurring. By sorting the float profiles into regimes, we can diagnose regions with larger variation of properties and highlight the transition of the properties across regimes. Given the increasing volume of observations that instruments like the Argo floats are building, a method such as the technique implemented in this study represents a valuable tool that can help to automatically reveal similarities in dynamical regimes.\\n   Key Points\\n   An unsupervised classification technique, applied to temperature and salinity float data, is used to sort the profiles into frontal zones In eddy fields the variability of physical and biogeochemical properties is more than twice as large as the mean zonal variability The intense eddy variability drives lateral physical processes that cause the large property variance\\nC1 [Rosso, Isabella; Mazloff, Matthew R.; Talley, Lynne D.; Purkey, Sarah G.; Freeman, Natalie M.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.\\n   [Maze, Guillaume] Univ Brest, CNRS, IFREMER, IRD,IUEM,Lab Oceanog Phys & Spatiale, F-29280 Plouzane, France.\\nRP Rosso, I (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.\\nEM irosso@ucsd.edu\\nRI Freeman, Natalie M/F-8672-2015; Maze, Guillaume/AAB-4078-2019\\nOI Freeman, Natalie M/0000-0002-4718-5650; Maze,\\n   Guillaume/0000-0001-7231-2095; Talley, Lynne/0000-0003-1574-729X;\\n   Purkey, Sarah/0000-0002-1893-6224; rosso, isabella/0000-0002-6761-7297\\nFU National Science Foundation, Division of Polar Programs [NSF PLR\\n   -1425989]; National Science Foundation [PLR-1425989]; French national\\n   programme LEFE/INSU, project SOMOVAR\\nFX SOCCOM data were collected and made freely available by the Southern\\n   Ocean Carbon and Climate Observations and Modeling Project funded by the\\n   National Science Foundation, Division of Polar Programs (NSF PLR\\n   -1425989), supplemented by NASA, and by the International Argo Program\\n   and the NOAA programs that contribute to it.

Irregular, intense pulses of particulate organic carbon (POC) have been found to make up about one-third of the overall POC fluxes at a long-term deep-sea research station influenced by coastal upwelling of the California Current, Station M (34 degrees 50/N, 123 degrees W, 4000 m depth). However, the drivers of these pulses have been challenging to quantify. It has long been recognized that ocean currents can result in particles being advected while sinking to the point of collection by a sediment trap. Thus, a sediment trap time series can incorporate material from a dynamic catchment area, a concept sometimes referred to as a statistical funnel. This concept raises many questions including: what are the day-to-day conditions at the source locations of the sinking POC? And, how might such \\'ocean weather\\' and related ecosystem factors influence the intense variation seen at the seafloor? Here we analyzed three-dimensional ocean currents from a Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) model from 2011 to 2017 to trace the potential source locations of particles sinking at 1000, 100, and 50 m d(-1) from an export depth of 100 m. We then used regionally tailored satellite data products to estimate export flux of POC from these locations. For the 100 m d(-1) speed, the particles had origins of up to similar to 300 km horizontal distance from the sediment trap location, moored at Station M at 3400 m depth., and nearly 1000 km for the 50 m speed. Particle tracking indicated that, there was considerable inter-annual variation in source locations. Particle source locations tended to originate from the east in the summer months, with higher export and POC fluxes. Occasionally these locations were in the vicinity of highly productive ocean features nearer to the coast. We found significant correlations between export flux of organic carbon from the estimated source locations at 100 m depth to trap-estimated POC fluxes at 3400 m depth. These results set the stage for further investigation into sinking speed distributions, conditions at the source locations, and comparisons with mechanistic biogeochemical models and between particle tracking model frameworks.\\nC1 [Ruhl, Henry A.; Bahr, Frederick L.; Daniel, Patrick] Monterey Bay Aquarium Res Inst, 7700 Sandholdt Rd, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA.\\n   [Ruhl, Henry A.; Henson, Stephanie A.; Hosking, W.

This interface zone, the benthic boundary layer, is critical to biogeochemical exchanges between pelagic and benthic communities. A conspicuous member of this benthic boundary layer community in the abyssal Northeast Pacific (Sta. M; 4000 m depth) is the hydrozoan medusa, Benthocodon pedunculata. A 3-year time-series study was conducted of B. pedunculata from October 2014 to November 2017 using an autonomous time-lapse camera system and acoustic current meter deployed on the sea floor. Remotely operated vehicle benthic video transects and collections were also conducted during six servicing cruises for the long-term instruments. Over three years, a total of 123,887 B. pedunculata were recorded in hourly images with densities ranging from 0 to a high of 33 individuals m(-3) in March 2016. Density of B. pedunculata was highest when current speeds were low, and declined precipitously as speed increased beyond similar to 1 cm s(-1). Movement of B. pedunculata was parallel to the continental margin in northwest and southeast directions. The large numbers of B. pedunculata observed over this 3-year study suggests their ecological importance in the benthic boundary layer food web at Sta.

The retrieval algorithm is based on the surface wave signal within three-dimensional wave number frequency MR backscatter intensity variance spectra. The MR data were collected during a research cruise that investigated submesoscale processes and their impact on oil spill transport in the Louisiana Bight. The MR currents and bathymetry are validated using measurements from 500 GPS-equipped surface drifters, a shipboard acoustic Doppler current profiler, and a shipboard single-beam echo sounder. Earlier results from the same experiment but using a different set of sensors indicate strong upper ocean vertical current shear over a 3.5 hr period, despite only mild wind forcing. Here, the MR currents are derived as a function of wave number, providing a measure of vertical shear for the full duration of the cruise. Strong vertical shear is frequently observed, with a maximum difference of 0.42 m/s between the MR high (effective depth of similar to 0.9 m) and low (similar to 2.4 m) wave number bins. Treating the drifter and echo sounder measurements as truth, the accuracies of the MR near-surface currents and bathymetry are 0.04-0.07 m/s and 1.2 m (or 7% of the mean water depth). However, it is shown that similar to 50% of the MR high wave number and drifter current differences is due to vertical shear. The shallow water MR near-surface current accuracy thus matches findings from a previous deep water validation where vertical shear was much weaker.\\nC1 [Lund, B.; Haus, B. K.; Graber, H.

This paper presents a comprehensive description of the physical environment of Andvord Bay, a glacial fjord located in the Gerlache Strait on the northern end of the Peninsula. Measurements were collected as part of the FjordEco program between November 2015 and March 2017, including during three research cruises and from a number of fixed installations (sub-surface moorings, time lapse cameras, and automatic weather stations). Andvord Bay is located just north of a sill in the Gerlache Strait. This sill inhibits the direct influence of warm Upper Circumpolar Deep Water from the shelf, and deep waters in the fjord are therefore relatively cold. As a result, glaciers in Andvord Bay are not subject to the substantial ocean-driven retreat observed farther south on the Peninsula. Instead, mass flux from the glaciers occurs mainly through calving. The influence of meltwater in Andvord Bay is small compared to glacial fjords in the Arctic and in the South Shetland Islands, although summer freshening is evident in the fjord near-surface layer, likely as a result of glacial inputs. The combination of surface freshening and the absence of strong mean wind forcing in the fjord results in salinity stratification extending well into the euphotic zone, providing advantageous conditions for phytoplankton blooms. Andvord Bay is generally dynamically quiet compared to the ambient ocean, with the exception of during local katabatic wind events. Exchange with the Gerlache Strait is weak, although the deep waters of the fjord are replenished on an annual scale through slow lateral exchange with the outside. In addition, deep convection may play a role in ventilating subsurface waters in winter.\\nC1 [Lundesgaard, Oyvind; Powell, Brian; Smith, Craig R.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.\\n   [Winsor, Peter; Truffer, Martin; Statscewich, Hank] Univ Alaska, Fairbanks, AK 99701 USA.\\n   [Merrifield, Mark] Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA USA.\\n   [Eidam, Emily] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA.\\nRP Lundesgaard, O (通讯作者)，Norwegian Polar Res Inst, Tromso, Norway.\\nEM oyvind.lundesgaard@gmail.com\\nOI Eidam, Emily/0000-0002-1906-8692; Lundesgaard,\\n   Oyvind/0000-0002-3410-8904\\nFU National Science Foundation [OPP 1443680, OPP 1443733, OPP 1443705];\\n   Rockland Scientific\\nFX This research was supported by the National Science Foundation under\\n   awards OPP 1443680 to C.

Based on the output from a 1/30 degrees OGCM simulation, spatiotemporal characteristics and generation mechanisms of submesoscales in the NE-SCS are investigated in this study. Through examining the submesoscale relative vorticity and vertical velocity, the regions southwest of Taiwan (ST) and Luzon Strait (LS) are identified as two hot spots of submesoscales in the NE-SCS. Seasonally, the submesoscales in region ST are much stronger in winter than summer, while those in LS do not show a significant seasonality. Statistical analysis suggests that the strength of submesoscales in regions ST and LS is highly correlated with the product of mixed-layer depth and mesoscale strain rate (MSR) and with the MSR itself, respectively. By conducting theoretical scaling and energetics analysis, the authors find that the mixed-layer instability whose strength is determined by the combination of mixed-layer depth and MSR and the barotropic instability associated with current-islands interactions are the dominant generation mechanisms of submesoscales in the above two regions, respectively. Further examinations of the submesoscale energy budget indicate that, to keep a balanced state, the generated submesoscales have to be dissipated by a forward energy cascade, highlighting the important role of submesoscales in the energy balance of the NE-SCS circulation.\\n   Plain Language Summary Oceanic submesoscale currents play important roles in energy budgets and material transport in the upper ocean. Marked by horizontal and temporal scales of O(1-10 km) and O(1-10 days) at midlatitudes, these currents are poorly studied in the South China Sea. In this study, the spatiotemporal characteristics and generation mechanisms of submesoscales are investigated in the northeastern South China Sea using output from a 1/30 degrees ocean model. Based on the simulated relative vorticity and vertical velocity, the regions southwest of Taiwan and Luzon Strait are identified as two hot spots of submesoscales. In the region southwest of Taiwan, the submesoscales are strong in winter but weak in summer; the submesoscales here are generated primarily through mixed-layer baroclinic instability whose strength is determined by the combination of mixed-layer depth and the deformation rates of mesoscale eddies. For the Luzon Strait, the submesoscales do not have significant seasonality, and their generations are through barotropic instability associated with the current-islands interactions.\\nC1 [Zhang, Zhiwei; Zhang, Yuchen; Sun, Zhongbin; Zhang, Xincheng; Zhao, Wei; Tian, Jiwei] Ocean Univ China, IAOS, Phys Oceanog Lab, Qingdao, Peoples R China.\\n   [Zhang, Zhiwei; Zhang, Yuchen; Sun, Zhongbin; Zhang, Xincheng; Zhao, Wei; Tian, Jiwei] Ocean Univ China, Frontiers Sci Ctr Deep Ocean Multispheres & Earth, Qingdao, Peoples R China.\\n   [Zhang, Zhiwei; Zhao, Wei; Tian, Jiwei] Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Ocean Dynam & Climate, Qingdao, Peoples R China.\\n   [Qiu, Bo] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Oceanog, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.\\n   [Sasaki, Hideharu] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Applicat Lab, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan.\\nRP Zhang, ZW (通讯作者)，Ocean Univ China, IAOS, Phys Oceanog Lab, Qingdao, Peoples R China.; Zhang, ZW (通讯作者)，Ocean Univ China, Frontiers Sci Ctr Deep Ocean Multispheres & Earth, Qingdao, Peoples R China.; Zhang, ZW (通讯作者)，Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Ocean Dynam & Climate, Qingdao, Peoples R China.\\nEM zzw330@ouc.edu.cn\\nRI Qiu, Bo/D-9569-2017\\nOI Sasaki, Hideharu/0000-0003-0657-7532\\nFU National Natural Science Foundation of China [41706005, 91958205,\\n   91858203]; National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFA0605702,\\n   2016YFC1402605]; Global Change and Air-sea Interaction Project\\n   [GASI-IPOVAI-01-03]; JAMSTEC\\nFX This work is jointly supported by the National Natural Science\\n   Foundation of China (Grants 41706005, 91958205, and 91858203), the\\n   National Key R&D Program of China (Grants 2018YFA0605702 and\\n   2016YFC1402605), and the Global Change and Air-sea Interaction Project\\n   (Grant GASI-IPOVAI-01-03).

Under sustained 5-6 m s(-1) winds, energetic Langmuir cells are clearly delineated in the spatially dense plate observations. Within 10 min of release, the plates collect in windrows with 15-m spacing aligned with the wind. Windrow spacing grows, through windrow merger, to 40 m after 20 min and then expands at a slower rate to 50 m. The presence of Langmuir cells produces strong horizontal anisotropy and scale dependence in all surface dispersion statistics computed from the plate observations. Relative dispersion in the crosswind direction initially dominates but eventually saturates, while downwind dispersion exhibits continual growth consistent with contributions from both turbulent fluctuations and organized mean shear. Longitudinal velocity differences in the crosswind direction indicate mean convergence at scales below the Langmuir cell diameter and mean divergence at larger scales. Although the second-order structure function measured by contemporaneous GPS-tracked surface drifters drogued at similar to 0.5 m shows persistent r(2/3) power law scaling down to 100-200-m separation scales, the second-order structure function for the very near surface plates observations has considerably higher energy and significantly shallower slope at scales below 100 m. This is consistent with contemporaneous data from undrogued surface drifters and previously published model results indicating shallowing spectra in the presence of direct wind-wave forcing mechanisms.\\nC1 [Chang, Henry; Huntley, Helga S.; Kirwan, A.

Among satellite-based estimates, variation has been attributed to differing assumptions about the relationships between photosynthesis and sea surface temperature (SST). Maximum chlorophyll (Chl)-specific rates of carbon fixation in the water column (P-opt(B)) increase monotonically with SST in some satellite algorithms, whereas others peak at intermediate values. Understanding and constraining such relationships is challenged by the many direct and indirect relationships between temperature and phytoplankton. In this article, the emergent P-opt(B)-SST relationship was diagnosed in a global biogeochemical simulation and compared with widely used satellite NPP algorithms. The simulated P-opt(B)-SST relationship for the aggregated phytoplankton community was highly significant (r(2) = 0.83) and increased monotonically with temperature. The P-opt(B)-SST relationships for small and large phytoplankton, however, were distinct and weaker than the aggregate relationship (r(2) = 0.52 and 0.36, respectively). For small phytoplankton, the inhibitory effect of nutrient limitation inwarmer, more stratifiedwaterswas moderated by efficient nutrient scavenging. This, combined with photoacclimation and the stimulatory effect of warming on maximum growth produced steep P-opt(B) increases with SST. For large phytoplankton, the need for higher Chl:C in productive regions (because of package effects) and the onset of severe nutrient limitation in warm, stratified regions decreased PB opt relative to small phytoplankton, though P-opt(B) still increased modestly with SST. The P-opt(B)-SST relationships for both small and large phytoplankton overestimated P-opt(B) in nutrient-poor regions and underestimated it in nutrient-rich regions. This bias was greatly reduced in the aggregate relationship because the increased prominence of low-P-opt(B) large phytoplankton in nutrient-rich environments tempered P-opt(B) increases. Results support a strong, monotonically increasing PBopt-SST relationship but emphasize the role of the size structure of the phytoplankton community in shaping the emergent relationship. The implications of these results are discussed in relation to efforts to improve satellite NPP algorithms and partition NPP by phytoplankton size.\\nC1 [Stock, Charles A.] NOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ 08550 USA.\\nRP Stock, CA (通讯作者)，NOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ 08550 USA.\\nEM charles.stock@noaa.gov\\nNR 69\\nTC 1\\nZ9 1\\nU1 0\\nU2 4\\nPU SEARS FOUNDATION MARINE RESEARCH\\nPI NEW HAVEN\\nPA YALE UNIV, KLINE GEOLOGY LAB, 210 WHITNEY AVENUE, NEW HAVEN, CT\\n   06520-8109 USA\\nSN 0022-2402\\nEI 1543-9542\\nJ9 J MAR RES\\nJI J.

At about 190 km off the Texas coast, at the top the seamount in the East FGB, up to 82% of coral reef organisms were affected in a 1-2 m thick layer on the local seafloor at similar to 23 in depth. Analysis of available data pointed to low levels of dissolved oxygen being the most likely contributing factor in the observed mortality (Johnston et al., 2019).\\n   Observations show that upwelling-favorable winds in June and July 2016 carried brackish and turbid coastal waters across the northwestern Gulf of Mexico continental shelf to the FGB. This plume of coastal water was the result of exceptionally high precipitation and local river run-off. Field data provide clear evidence of thin, localized, subsurface near-hypoxic layers immediately below this turbid, low salinity coastal plume. These midwater layers extended over longer distances (30-40 kin), and reached further offshore (similar to 100 km), than previously reported in the region, associated with large quantities of organic matter carried offshore by the brackish plume.\\n   The surface brackish layer was observed to cover the East FGB in satellite ocean color imagery and in situ salinity measurements in late June and July 2016. Model results and sparse observations on the shelf suggest that this surface layer was similar to 20 m thick. It is expected that organic matter carried in the surface layer accumulated on the seafloor of the East FGB, which was just below the brackish plume. In the absence of ventilation, this led to the local formation of a bottom hypoxic layer, similar to what is observed on the Gulf of Mexico inner to midshelf every summer.\\n   The conditions experienced at FGB in July 2016 are likely to affect other reefs exposed to brackish plumes with high organic matter loads. The processes of physical connectivity by transport of material is critical for reef colonization and survival, but can also be fatal to coral ecosystems. The monitoring of coral reefs should take the threat of hypoxia due to distant sources of organic matter into account.\\nC1 [Le Henaff, Matthieu] Univ Miami, CIMAS, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA.\\n   [Le Henaff, Matthieu] NOAA, AOML, 4301 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA.\\n   [Muller-Karger, Frank E.; Otis, Daniel] USF, CMS, 140 7th Ave South, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA.\\n   [Kourafalou, Vassiliki H.; Kang, HeeSook] Univ Miami, RSMAS, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA.\\n   [Johnson, Kimberley A.] NOAA, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr SEFSC, 75 Virginia Beach Dr, Miami, FL 33149 USA.\\n   [McEachron, Lucas] Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss FWC, 100 8th Ave SE, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA.\\nRP Le Henaff, M (通讯作者)，UM, CIMAS, NOAA, AOML, 4301 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA.\\nEM m.lehenaff@miami.edu\\nFU National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration RESTORE Act Science\\n   Program [NA15NOS4510226]; NASA [NNX14AP62A, NOPP RFP\\n   NOAA-NOS-IOOS-2014-2003803]; NOAA Integrated Ocean Observing System\\n   (IOOS) Program Office; NOAA Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological\\n   Laboratory; Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies\\n   (CIMAS), a cooperative institute of the University of Miami; NOAA\\n   [NA100AR4320143]; NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS);\\n   Southeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program (SEAMAP) in the GoM\\nFX This paper is a result of research funded by the National Oceanic and\\n   Atmospheric Administration RESTORE Act Science Program under award\\n   NA15NOS4510226 to the University of Miami.

Consequently, the ecosystem responses to climate variability could be region-dependent. A model-based analysis from this study synthesized the complex biological-physical interactions across the EJS, and suggested an intricate role of water column stability in driving the observed seasonal and basin-scale variability. Compared to the northern EJS (e.g., the Japan Basin), the southern EJS (e.g., the Ulleung and Yamato Basins) has a more favorable mixing regime for higher productivity in both winter and summer, balancing the need for phytoplankton growth in terms of nutrient and light availability. The wintertime water column in the southern EJS is relatively stable compared with the northern EJS due to the influx of warm Tsushima Warm Current (TWC) water and also weaker surface atmospheric cooling, leading to decreased light limitation for primary production in the south than in the north. During the stratified summer season, the surface stirring and mixing, due to the energy dissipation of strong TWC inflow, promote a relatively less stable surface mixed layer in the south than that in the north, and thus alleviate the nutrient limitation at the surface. In addition, the current- and wind-induced upwelling along the east coast of Korea further enhances the productivity in the southwestern EJS. The general south-north \\'see-saw\\' pattern of mixing regime, combined with upwelling-downwelling switching, could be the key driver for the observed production patterns in the EJS.\\nC1 [Ji, Rubao] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Biol, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\n   [Jin, Meibing] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Marine Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.\\n   [Jin, Meibing] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Int Arctic Res Ctr, Fairbanks, AK USA.\\n   [Li, Yun] Univ Delaware, Coll Earth Ocean & Environm, Sch Marine Sci & Policy, Lewes, DE USA.\\n   [Kang, Yun-Ho; Kang, Chang-Keun] Gwangju Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Earth Sci & Environm Engn, Gwangju, South Korea.\\nRP Ji, RB (通讯作者)，Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Biol, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.; Jin, MB (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Marine Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.\\nEM rji@whoi.edu; mjin@nuist.edu.cn\\nFU Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries, Korea\\nFX This research was supported by \"Long-term change of structure and\\n   function in marine ecosystems of Korea\" with funding from the Ministry\\n   of Oceans and Fisheries, Korea.

Data were extracted from the GLODAPv2 data product as well as two GEOTRACERS cruises in the Arctic Ocean from 2015 and C-ant was evaluated using the transient time distribution (TTD) approach. In the Nansen and Amundsen sub-basins, the C-ant trend in the Atlantic Waters (AW, depths: 200-500 m) and dense AW (dAW, depths: 500-800 m) is about + 0.7 mu mol kg(-1) yr(-1). As we move into the Makarov and West Canadian sub-basins, the C-ant trend in the AW and dAW is smaller. The upper Polar Deep Water (uPDW, depths: 800-1600 m) has a C-ant trend of about +0.4-0.5 mu mol kg(-1) yr(-1) in the Nansen, Amundsen and West Canadian sub-basins. The trend is smallest in the South Canadian sub-basin, with a value of about + 0.2 mu mol kg(-1) yr(-1). Ventilation primarily governs C(ant )trends while the influence of the Revelle factor plays a secondary role. The increase in the C-ant column inventory is estimated to be 0.7-1.0 mol C m(-2) yr(-1) in the Nansen, Amundsen and Makarov sub-basins. By extrapolating the results from our defined sub-basins to the full Arctic Ocean, we estimate an C-ant accumulation of 25 Tg C yr(-1) in the Arctic Ocean and an inventory of about 3.6-3.9 Pg C between 2005 and 2015.\\nC1 [Rajasakaren, Balamuralli; Jeansson, Emil] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, NORCE Norwegian Res Ctr, Bergen, Norway.\\n   [Olsen, Are; Johannessen, Truls] Univ Bergen, Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Geophys Inst, Bergen, Norway.\\n   [Tanhua, Toste] GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, Kiel, Germany.\\n   [Smethie, W.

In particular, the isopycnal slopes determine where each water mass outcrops and thus how the ocean interacts with the atmosphere. The region-integrated isopycnal slopes have been suggested to be eddy saturated, that is, stay relatively constant as the wind forcing changes, but whether or not the flow is saturated in realistic present day and future parameter regimes is unknown. This study analyzes an idealized two-layer quasigeostrophic channel model forced by a wind stress and a residual overturning generated by a mass flux across the interface between the two layers, with and without a blocking ridge. The sign and strength of the residual overturning set which way the isopycnal slopes change with the wind forcing, leading to an increase in slope with an increase in wind forcing for a positive overturning and a decrease in slope for a negative overturning, following the usual conventions; this behavior is caused by the dominant standing meander weakening as the wind stress weakens causing the isopycnal slopes to become more sensitive to changes in the wind stress and converge with the slopes of a flat-bottomed simulation. Eddy saturation only appears once the wind forcing passes a critical level. These results show that theories for saturation must have both topography and residual overturning in order to be complete and provide a framework for understanding how the isopycnal slopes in the Southern Ocean may change in response to future changes in wind forcing.\\nC1 [Youngs, Madeleine K.] MIT WHOI Joint Program Oceanog, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.\\n   [Flierl, Glenn R.; Ferrari, Raffaele] MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA USA.\\nRP Youngs, MK (通讯作者)，MIT WHOI Joint Program Oceanog, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.\\nEM myoungs@mit.edu\\nFU NSF [OCE-1536515, AGS1835576, OCE-1459702]; NDSEG\\nFX MKY and RF acknowledge support through NSF Awards OCE-1536515 and\\n   AGS1835576.

The data reveal a predominantly alongshore flow, under westward wind forcing, with localized offshore current veering over the SFCR crests and an onshore veering over the adjacent troughs. Alongshore momentum balance analysis of the observations reveals that total acceleration (i.e., local and advective) and bottom stress are balanced by wind stress and pressure gradient. A numerical model is used to verify the experimentally derived results and to analyze the cross-shore momentum balance which is not resolved by the experimental data. Analysis of the numerical and field data reveal that the total alongshore pressure gradient force can be considered as the sum of a local and a regional component. The former is correlated with the alongshore advective acceleration that develops over the crest of the ridges resembling a Bernoulli-like pressure flow relationship. The regional alongshore pressure gradient is related to wind stress with which it maintains a strong, negative relationship. Over the ridge crests the cross-shore veering of the flow is due to mass conservation, associated with a balance between cross-shore advective acceleration and local cross-shore pressure gradient. Under variable wind conditions the regional pressure gradients are more important, as compared to quasi steady-state conditions which increase the influence of the local scale pressure gradient. A time scale of 6 h is found as the temporal scale required for the local pressure gradients to make a significant contribution to the momentum balance.\\nC1 [Ofsthun, Conor; Wu, Xiaodong; Voulgaris, George] Univ South Carolina, Sch Earth Ocean & Environm, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.\\n   [Warner, John C.] US Geol Survey, Coastal & Marine Geol Program, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\n   [Ofsthun, Conor] Moffatt & Nichol, San Diego, CA 92108 USA.\\n   [Wu, Xiaodong] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.\\nRP Ofsthun, C (通讯作者)，Univ South Carolina, Sch Earth Ocean & Environm, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.; Ofsthun, C (通讯作者)，Moffatt & Nichol, San Diego, CA 92108 USA.\\nEM cofsthun@moffattnichol.com\\nRI Wu, Xiaodong/AAH-9306-2021\\nFU U.S. Geological Survey\\nFX Observational data was collected through the Fire Island Coastal Change\\n   project, a cooperative study supported by the U.S. Geological Survey.\\n   The manuscript was prepared with the support of and while one of the\\n   authors (George Voulgaris) was serving at the US National Science\\n   Foundation.

Subsequent to studies of this bay during the summer of 2013, an investigation was conducted in the autumn (dry season) to better understand the interactive effects of light, temperature, and nutrient concentrations on phytoplankton growth in the bay. Analyses of long-term data showed that dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations had increased roughly sixfold to eightfold since the 1980s as a result of nitrogen fertilizer use, pollution from industrial wastewater and domestic sewage, and loss of wetlands and their water purification service. In contrast, phosphate and silicate concentrations have decreased by factors of 2 and 5, respectively, during the past half century because of anthropogenic reductions of sediment loads (e.g., the construction of check dams and reservoirs and large-scale vegetation restoration projects). We found no evidence that phytoplankton growth was limited by nitrogen or phosphorus. Plots of nitrate and silicate concentrations versus salinity indicated conservative mixing in both cases. Analogous plots of ammonium and phosphate revealed a net uptake and net input, respectively. Phytoplankton uptake likely accounted for the net uptake of ammonium, and desorption of phosphorus from suspended particulate matter for the net input of phosphate. The major factors controlling phytoplankton growth in this study were light availability and temperature. Nearly all incoming photosynthetically active radiation was attenuated in the water column, and less than 1% of the light energy was absorbed by phytoplankton. Comparisons of this study with previous work in Liaodong Bay during the summer and similar case studies in contrasting regions of the world revealed a general pattern of regional maxima of phytoplankton biomass (or even harmful algal blooms) and changes of community structure associated with light availability and temperature variations in the presence of growth-rate-saturating nutrient concentrations.\\nC1 [Pei, Shaofeng; Zhu, Yaxuan; Ye, Siyuan; Yuan, Hongming; Ding, Xigui] China Geol Survey, Key Lab Coastal Wetland Biogeosci, Qingdao 266071, Shandong, Peoples R China.\\n   [Pei, Shaofeng; Ye, Siyuan] Natl Oceanog Lab, Lab Marine Geol, Qingdao 266061, Shandong, Peoples R China.\\n   [Laws, Edward A.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Coll Coast & Environm, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.\\n   [Zhang, Haibo] Ocean Univ China, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, Qingdao 266100, Shandong, Peoples R China.\\nRP Laws, EA (通讯作者)，Louisiana State Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Coll Coast & Environm, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.\\nEM edlaws@lsu.edu\\nFU National Natural Science Foundation of China [41306175]; Funding of\\n   Science and Technology Activities for Scholars from Abroad, Science and\\n   Technology Development Fund Project in Shinan District [2013-14-007-JY];\\n   Ministry of Land and Resources program [201111023]; China Geological\\n   Survey [DD20160144, GZH201200503]; Key Program for International Science\\n   & Technology Cooperation Projects of China [2016yee0109600]\\nFX This study was jointly funded by National Natural Science Foundation of\\n   China (Grant No. 41306175), Funding of Science and Technology Activities\\n   for Scholars from Abroad, Science and Technology Development Fund\\n   Project in Shinan District (2013-14-007-JY), Ministry of Land and\\n   Resources program (Grant No. 201111023), China Geological Survey (Grant\\n   Nos.

To investigate how cross-ecosystem differences in these drivers determine fish assemblages and productivity, we constructed a spatially explicit mechanistic model of three fish functional types: forage, large pelagic, and demersal fishes. The model is based on allometric scaling principles, includes basic life cycle transitions, and has trophic interactions between the fishes and with their pelagic and benthic food resources. The model was applied to the global ocean, with plankton food web estimates and ocean conditions from a high-resolution earth system model. Further, a simple representation of fishing was included, and led to moderate matches with total, large pelagic, and demersal catches, including re-creation of observed variations in fish catch spanning two orders of magnitude. Our results highlight several ecologically meaningful model sensitivities. First, coexistence between forage and large pelagic fish in productive regions occurred when forage fish survival is promoted via both favorable metabolic allometry and enhanced predator avoidance in adult forage fish. Second, the prominence of demersal fish is highly sensitive to the efficiency of energy transfer to benthic invertebrates. Third, the latitudinal distribution of the total catch is modulated by the temperature dependence of metabolic rates, with increased sensitivity pushing fish biomass toward the poles. Fourth, forage fish biomass is suppressed by strong top-down controls on temperate and subpolar shelves, where mixed assemblages of large pelagic and demersal fishes exerted high predation rates. Last, spatial differences in the dominance of large pelagics vs. demersals is strongly related to the ratio of pelagic zooplankton production to benthic production. We discuss the potential linkages between model misfits and unresolved processes including movement, spawning phenology, seabird and marine mammal predators, and socioeconomically driven fishing pressure, which are identified as priorities for future model development. Ultimately, the model and analyses herein are intended as a baseline for a robust, mechanistic tool to understand, quantify, and predict global fish biomass and yield, now and in a future dominated by climate change and improved fishing technology.\\nC1 [Petrik, Colleen M.] Princeton Univ, Program Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.\\n   [Stock, Charles A.] NOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.\\n   [Andersen, Ken H.; van Denderen, P.

This constitutes the longest available uninterrupted oceanographic time series in the Mediterranean Sea. The present contribution focuses on observed climatic trends in temperature (degrees C/year) of air (AT; 0.05), sea surface (SST; 0.03), sea at 80 m depth (S80T; 0.02) and sea level (SL; 3.1 mm/year) as well as comparison with trends estimated from coincident high-resolution satellite data. The trending evolution is not uniform across seasons, being significantly higher in spring for both AT and SST, while in autumn for S80T. Other climatological results are a stratification increase (0.02 degrees C/year in summer temperature difference between 20 m (S20T) and S80T), trends in summer conditions at sea (when S20T > 18 degrees C), estimated as 0.5 and 0.9 days/year for the starting day and period respectively, and a decreasing trend of nearly 2 days/year in the period of conditions favourable for marine evaporation (when AT < SST). This last trend may be related to the observed decrease of coastal precipitation in spring. The long-term consistency in the in situ SST measurements presents an opportunity to validate the multi-decadal trends. The good agreement for 2013-2018 (RMS 0.5-0.6, bias - 0.1 to - 0.2; trends of 0.09 degrees C/year in situ vs. 0.06 to 0.08 degrees C/year from satellite) allows considering this observational site as ground truth for satellite observations and a monitoring site for climate change.\\nC1 [Salat, Jordi; Pascual, Josep] CSIC, ICM, Passeig Maritim Barceloneta 37-49, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain.\\n   [Flexas, Mar] CALTECH, 1200 E Calif Blvd, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.\\n   [Chin, Toshio Michael; Vazquez-Cuervo, Jorge] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, 4800 Oak Grove Dr, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA.\\nRP Salat, J (通讯作者)，CSIC, ICM, Passeig Maritim Barceloneta 37-49, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain.\\nEM salat@icm.csic.es\\nRI Salat, Jordi/F-9328-2013\\nOI Salat, Jordi/0000-0001-6139-5673; Flexas, Mar/0000-0002-0617-3004\\nFU National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) [NNX15AG42G]\\nFX The authors acknowledge technical support from the Institut de Ciencies\\n   del Mar (ICM/CSIC) to maintain the time series of L\\'Estartit.

The Delft3D model was used to perform numerical experiments that simulate the effect of wind-generated waves, wind-driven currents, river discharge, and tides on sediment dynamics in Sandy Point dredge pit. The hydrodynamics and sediment models were validated and calibrated using field data of current, wave, water level, and suspended sediment concentration. Two potential sources of sediment were examined: fluvial sediment from the Mississippi River and resuspended sediments from the seabed. Results showed that during a cold front, shear stress from wave motions played a significant role in the resuspension of sediments in Sandy Point dredge pit. The maximum cold front-related wave impact on sediment resuspension could increase near-bed sediment concentration in Sandy Point dredge pit by 20-50 times. In addition, the results suggest that the primary source of sediment for Sandy Point dredge pit during a cold front was resuspension from the ambient seabed due to increased bottom shear stress by wind-induced waves and strong southward wind-driven currents.

Eighty-seven glider transects across the mouth of the Sea over nine years describe the velocity structure and variability of this system. The time series spans two El Ninos and two La Ninas, which produced large transport anomalies, up to 50% of the mean. While transport increased during El Ninos and decreased during La Ninas, their signatures were inconsistent among the events. Separated glider tracks show the merging of two inflows, one from the tropics east of the Solomon Island chain, the other entering as a western boundary current generated by winds over the full subtropical gyre. A model of linear wind-driven dynamics, including western boundary currents, had skill in describing the variability of the two inflows, identifying the distinct wind forcing driving each. The model suggests that both the mean and low-frequency variability of flow entering the Solomon Sea are driven remotely by wind over the South Pacific, acting through long Rossby waves. The ultimate significance of in situ observations in this small sea will be to describe its role in subtropical-tropical heat exchange that is crucial to ENSO and longer-timescale climate variations along the equator. We take an initial step here, suggesting that temperature advection through the Solomon Sea is a first-order contribution to interannual temperature changes of the equatorial strip as a whole.\\nC1 [Kessler, William S.; Hristova, Hristina G.] NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.\\n   [Hristova, Hristina G.] Univ Hawaii, Joint Inst Marine & Atmospher Res, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.\\n   [Davis, Russ E.] Scripps Inst Oceanog, San Diego, CA USA.\\nRP Kessler, WS (通讯作者)，NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.\\nEM william.s.kessler@noaa.gov\\nFU NOAA\\'s Ocean Observation and Monitoring Division\\nFX We thank Solomon Islanders Danny and Kerrie Kennedy, Wryne Lingisasa,\\n   Irving Eddie, John Vao, and Bradley Taino who expertly and safely\\n   captain the small boats for glider deployments and recoveries.

PV is dominated by its linear components-vertical vorticity and vortex stretching, each with an rms value of similar to 0.15f. In the internal wave frequency band, they are coherent and in phase, as expected for linear internal waves. Packets of strong, >0.2f, vertical vorticity and vortex stretching balance closely with a small net rms PV. The PV spectrum peaks at the highest resolvable vertical wavenumber, similar to 0.1 cpm. The PV frequency spectrum has a red spectral shape, a -1 spectral slope in the internal wave frequency band, and a small peak at the inertial frequency. PV measured at near-inertial frequencies is partially attributed to the non-Lagrangian nature of float measurements. Measurement errors and the vortical mode also contribute to PV in the internal wave frequency band. The vortical mode Burger number, computed using time rates of change of vertical vorticity and vortex stretching, is 0.2-0.4, implying a horizontal kinetic energy to available potential energy ratio of similar to 0.1. The vortical mode energy frequency spectrum is 1-2 decades less than the observed energy spectrum. Vortical mode energy is likely underestimated because its energy at vertical scales > 70 m was not measured. The vortical mode to total energy ratio increases with vertical wavenumber, implying its importance at small vertical scales.\\nC1 [Lien, Ren-Chieh; Sanford, Thomas B.] Univ Washington, Appl Phys Lab, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.\\n   [Lien, Ren-Chieh; Sanford, Thomas B.] Univ Washington, Sch Oceanog, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.\\nRP Lien, RC (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Appl Phys Lab, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.\\nEM rcl@uw.edu\\nFU U.S. Office of Naval Research [N00014-09-1-0193, N00014-15-2184]\\nFX The authors thank the crew and officers of the R/V Oceanus and LatMix\\n   group for the EM-APEX float deployments and recoveries.

Each simulation has started at the end of previous 100-years spin-up and control run. The model surface boundary conditions, from the corrected ERA-40 re-analyses (Pettenuzzo et al., 2010) and three momentum flux ensemble members are based on a surface wind Bayesian Hierarchical Models (BHM) - Mediterranean Forecasting System (MFS-Wind-BHM) described in Berliner and Kim (2007) and Milliff et al. (2011), cover the period January 1958 to December 2001. The results have been validated by an Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis of surface sea height anomalies for satellite and Med-ROMS Hindcasts. The correlation coefficients between Med-ROMS (Principal Component) PC1 (Sea Surface Height anomaly) SSHa hindcasts 1, 2, 3 and AVISO satellite are 0.985, 0.97 and 0.98 respectively, all values are significant at 95% confidence limit. We have defined a Bimodal Oscillating System mechanism responsible for decadal reversals of the Ionian basin-wide circulation (BiOS) (Gacic et al., 2011, 2014) as a pattern of Eastern Mediterranean climate change. The ROMS model successfully simulated the observed general circulation pattern in the Eastern Mediterranean. Over the period from July 1997 till December 2001, the Med-ROMS has successfully simulated the north Ionian inversion; SSHa same as Satellite SSH with an averaged RMSE between them of 0.0792 m. The spatial correlation maps between wind stress curl and Med-ROMS-SSHa/EOF1-SSHa are made and found to be significantly correlated at a 95% confidence limit. The highest significant correlation coefficient for Med-ROMS-SSHa was approximately 0.8 and located off the western Turkish coast inside the Aegean Sea. This strong significant positive correlation reflects the cyclonic motion of Rhodes Gyre. A high significant correlation coefficient for Med-ROMS-EOFIASHa, of around 0.51, was found along the western coast of Greece in the northeast Ionian Sea. For the first time, we could correlate the North Ionian Sea inversion to wind stress curl, which was significantly correlated with the EOF1 Med-ROMS SSHa averaged hindcasts during the inversion period. In this transient period, we noticed a significant correlation coefficient, at a 95% confidence limit, between NAO indices moving on average over 12 months and Med-ROMS-SSHa -PC1 over the Eastern Mediterranean.\\nC1 [Nagy, Hazem; El-Gindy, Ahmed] Alexandria Univ, Fac Sci, Oceanog Dept, Alexandria, Egypt.\\n   [Di Lorenzo, Emanuele] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Earth & Atmospher Sci, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.\\n   [Nagy, Hazem] Marine Inst, Galway, Ireland.\\nRP Nagy, H (通讯作者)，Marine Inst, Galway, Ireland.\\nEM hznagy@ims.metu.edu.tr\\nRI Nagy, Hazem/P-5312-2019; Di Lorenzo, Emanuele/E-9107-2012\\nOI Nagy, Hazem/0000-0002-7206-4113; Di Lorenzo,\\n   Emanuele/0000-0002-1935-7363\\nFU FULBRIGHT Commission in Egypt\\nFX We are grateful to FULBRIGHT Commission in Egypt for supporting this\\n   study.

In this study, we use 1-year long mooring data to determine dynamic and statistical features of the ISWs on the shelf slope of the northwestern SCS. The analysis results of the mooring data reveal that the ocean internal waves on the shelf slope of the northwestern SCS have physical properties of highly nonlinear waves, which are well described by the solutions of the Korteweg-de Vries equation. The mean nonlinear phase speeds of mode-1 and mode-2 ISWs are 1.38 0.14 and 0.66 0.12 m/s, respectively. The major direction of mode-1 ISWs is northwestward 305 degrees 21 degrees. Strong ISW currents force the major direction of total current velocities to turn 67.5 degrees in the upper layer and 135 degrees in the lower layer. The monthly occurrence frequency distribution of ISWs shows a peak in July with a maximum frequency of 16.2% and a trough in March with a minimum frequency of 3.3%. Mode-2 ISWs appear most in December, accounting for 50% of total mode-2 ISWs. The largest mode-2 ISW on record up today with the depressed amplitude as large as 91 m, and the elevated amplitude of 73 m was observed at mooring station. These new findings and new data are of significance to local internal wave prediction model development.\\n   Plain Language Summary Unlike the sea surface waves, the ocean internal waves are a sort of wave motions occurring in the ocean interior. Strong internal waves carry strong currents and huge power, which may greatly impact the normal ocean and cause harm to underwater navigation and ocean engineering facilities. Thus, it is a necessary work to clarify the internal wave activities in an area of interest. We deployed a chain of instrument system moored at the sea floor on the continental slope of the northwestern South China Sea, where is rich in oil and gas resources, to observe the internal waves for 1 year from June 2016 to July 2017. Using the data of observed 684 internal waves, we analyze their physical properties and statistical features. The results indicate that (1) the observed waves have typical features of internal solitary waves, (2) the maximum amplitude reaches near 100 m, and (3) strong internal wave currents force the major direction of normal current to turn about 70 degrees and 135 degrees in the upper and lower layers, respectively, and March and July are trough and peak months for internal wave occurrence. These data and results are of significance for underwater navigation safety and ocean engineering designs.\\nC1 [Chen, Liang; Xiong, Xuejun; Yuan, Yeli] Ocean Univ China, Coll Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China.\\n   [Chen, Liang; Xiong, Xuejun; Yuan, Yeli; Xie, Huarong; Guo, Yanliang; Yu, Long; Yun, Shengjun] Minist Nat Resources China, Inst Oceanog 1, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China.\\n   [Zheng, Quanan] Univ Maryland, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.\\n   [Xiong, Xuejun; Yuan, Yeli] Pilot Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Funct Lab Reg Oceanog & Numer Modeling, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China.\\nRP Xiong, XJ (通讯作者)，Ocean Univ China, Coll Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China.; Xiong, XJ (通讯作者)，Minist Nat Resources China, Inst Oceanog 1, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China.; Xiong, XJ (通讯作者)，Pilot Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Funct Lab Reg Oceanog & Numer Modeling, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China.\\nEM xiongxj@fio.org.cn\\nOI Chen, Liang/0000-0003-0415-6101\\nFU National Science and Technology Major Project [2016ZX05057015]; National\\n   Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41376038, 40406009,\\n   41806123, 41506034]; NSFC-Shandong Joint Fund for Marine Science\\n   Research Centers [U1606405]; National Program on Global Change and\\n   Air-Sea Interaction [GASI-03-01-01-02, GASI02-IND-STSsum,\\n   GASI-IPOVAI01-05]; Public Science and Technology Research Funds Projects\\n   of Ocean [200905024]; National Key Scientific Instrument and Equipment\\n   Development Projects [2012YQ12003908]; Basic Scientific Fund for\\n   National Public Research Institutes of China [GY0213G02]\\nFX The authors appreciate three anonymous reviewers for comments that help\\n   to improve this manuscript substantially.

Nearshore Louisiana exemplifies the strong influence of the Mississippi and Atchafalaya rivers. Coastal salinities, temperatures, turbidities, and nutrients are directly affected, and the zone annually experiences the second largest eutrophication-induced marine hypoxic event. During the summers of 2013-14 we assessed the extent of river influence across the nearshore region of the Louisiana Continental Shelf by sampling water quality in water depths of 3.7-18 m. Single-variable spatial analyses and multivariate factor analysis suggested that the nearshore zone comprises three functionally-distinct hydrographic regions. Differences in bathymetry and freshwater input associated with delta morphology explained significant differences in mixing and stratification patterns among East, Central, and West regions of nearshore Louisiana. Additionally, intraregional differences occurred between waters overlying sandy shoals and those overlying the surrounding muddy sediments and with wind. Mean interregional surface-to-bottom density differences were 0.9, 3.2, and 9.2 kg m(-3), (West, Central, and East, respectively) and intraregional density differences were 2.1 over sand and 4.3 kg m(-3) over mud. The mean vertical extent of hypoxia (DO < 50% saturation) over sand was 0.6 m lower than over mud. Mean DO saturation was 33.1% and 21.4% greater over sand than over mud in the Central and West regions, respectively, but did not differ in the East. Mean DO saturation was up to 57.6% higher with southeasterly rather than northwesterly winds. These physicochemical patterns demonstrate the importance of physical factors influencing hypoxia and drive substantially different habitat quality within this dynamic, estuarine environment.\\nC1 [Munnelly, Ryan T.; Reeves, David B.; Baltz, Donald M.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Energy Coast & Environm Bldg, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.\\n   [Chesney, Edward J.] Louisiana Univ Marine Consortium, 8124 Hwy 56, Chauvin, LA 70344 USA.\\nRP Munnelly, RT (通讯作者)，Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, 100 8th Ave Southeast, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA.\\nEM ryan.munnelly@myfwc.com\\nOI Reeves, David/0000-0003-4161-8889\\nFU Bureau of Ocean Energy Management [M12AC00015]; Louisiana Department of\\n   Wildlife and Fisheries\\nFX Funding for this project was provided by the Bureau of Ocean Energy\\n   Management (project no.

Potential temperature-salinity diagrams constructed for regions where the seals remained for extended periods showed four water masses on the continental shelf: Modified Circumpolar Deep Water, Antarctic Surface Water, Shelf Water and Modified Shelf Water. Depth-time distributions of potential density and buoyancy frequency showed the erosion of the upper water column stratification associated with the transition from summer to fall/winter conditions. The within-year and interannual variability associated with this transition was related to wind speed. Changes in upper water column density were positively correlated with cross-shelf wind speeds > 5.5 m s(-1) with a 3-4 day lag. A range of wind speeds was required to erode the density structure because of different levels of stratification in each year. A comparison of wind mixing potential versus stratification (Wedderburn number) showed that synoptic scale wind events during 2012 with speeds of 5.5 and 6.5 m s(-1) were needed to erode the summer stratification for Ross Island and Victoria Land regions, respectively. Stronger winds ( > 8.5 m s(-1) ) were required during 2010 and 2011. The interannual variability in total heat content accumulated during summer (about 20%) was related to the duration of open water, with the largest heat content occurring in 2012, which was characterized by a summer sea ice minimum stronger than other years and relatively higher mCDW influence over the mid and outer-shelf regions. The heat content was lost after mid-April and reached a minimum in winter as a result of deep winter convection. The quantitative analysis of hydrographic variability of the inner-shelf region of the western Ross Sea obtained from the seal-derived measurements provides a baseline for assessing future changes.\\nC1 [Pinones, Andrea] Univ Austral Chile, Inst Ciencias Marinas & Limnol, Valdivia, Chile.\\n   [Pinones, Andrea] Univ Austral Chile, Ctr FONDAP Invest Dinam Ecosistemas Marinos Altas, Valdivia, Chile.\\n   [Pinones, Andrea] Univ Concepcion, Ctr Invest Oceanog COPAS AS Sur Austral, Concepcion, Chile.\\n   [Hofmann, Eileen E.; Dinniman, Michael S.; Klinck, John M.] Old Dominion Univ, Ctr Coastal Phys Oceanog, Norfolk, VA USA.\\n   [Costa, Daniel P.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.\\n   [Goetz, Kimberly] Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res NIWA, Newmarket, New Zealand.\\n   [Burns, Jennifer M.] Univ Alaska Anchorage, Dept Biol Sci, Anchorage, AK USA.\\n   [Roquet, Fabien] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Marine Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden.\\nRP Pinones, A (通讯作者)，Univ Austral Chile, Inst Ciencias Marinas & Limnol, Valdivia, Chile.\\nEM andrea.pinones@uach.cl\\nRI Goetz, Kimberly/AID-8232-2022; Burns, Jennifer/AAC-8243-2019\\nOI Burns, Jennifer/0000-0001-9652-2943; Roquet, Fabien/0000-0003-1124-4564;\\n   Klinck, John/0000-0003-4312-5201; Dinniman, Michael/0000-0001-7519-9278\\nFU National Science Foundation [ANT-0944174, ANT-0838911, ANT-0838892,\\n   ANT-0838937]; CONICYT/Chile through the Program FONDAP [15150003];\\n   CONICYT/Chile through PAI Project [79160077]\\nFX This study was supported by the National Science Foundation Grants\\n   ANT-0944174 (to EEH, JMK, MSD), ANT-0838911 (to EEH), ANT-0838892 (to\\n   DCP), and ANT-0838937 (to JMB).

Locating new vent sites on these ridges is important due to their tendency to host large seafloor massive sulfide deposits. It is also important as it can increase our understanding of the tectonics at ultraslow spreading ridges as well as giving us an understanding of how hydrothermal venting in these regions affect and interact with the surrounding water column. To assess the hydrothermal productivity of the slow to ultraslow spreading Mohns and Knipovich ridge segments of the Arctic Mid-Ocean Ridge we used the primordial isotope He-3. Due to the conservative nature of He-3, this isotope can function as a tracer both for hydrothermal activity and on the ocean current pathways. In addition to assessing the hydrothermal productivity of the ridges we also studied the impact the ridges have on ocean circulation. Between 2006 and 2016, 400 water samples were collected along the Mohns Ridge and the Knipovich Ridge and 117 samples were collected in two transects crossing each ridge. The results show that the surface mixed layer (500-0 m depth) directly above each ridge has higher than equilibrium values of delta He-3, which we interpret as an effect of the bottom topography on the vertical mixing. We also observe direct indications of at least two undiscovered vent sites along the Mohns Ridge, making the total count of 7 vent fields along this 550 km ridge segment, which gives a vent field frequency (F-s) of 1.27 sites/100 km. This number is comparable to the vent field frequency on other ultraslow ridges. By comparing the current speed to non-buoyant plume measurements obtained at the previously discovered Loki\\'s Castle and the Jan Mayen vent fields (JMVF) we made an estimate of the He-3 flux at these vent fields. This estimate gave a flux of 0.22 mmol/km/mm/yr from Loki\\'s Castle, which is well below the world\\'s average of 0.33 mmol/km/mm/yr. However, the flux rate estimated here is comparable to estimates previously calculated from the ultraslow Gakkel ridge. The northeastern termination of the Mohns Ridge, where Loki\\'s Castle is located, is also the thinnest part of the ridge segment indicating a low magmatic influence. The flux rate of the JMVF was 0.40 mmol/km/mm/yr and thus higher than the global average. This could indicate an influence from the Jan Mayen hot spot as similar flux rates has been found at other hot spot influenced vent sites. This study not only illuminates the hydrothermal productivity of ultraslow spreading ridges, but also adds a considerable dataset of helium isotopes in Nordic Seas.\\nC1 [Stensland, Anne; Baumberger, Tamara; Thorseth, Ingunn H.; Pedersen, Rolf B.] Univ Bergen, Dept Earth Sci, KG Jebsen Ctr Deep Sea Res, Ctr Geobiol, Bergen, Norway.\\n   [Baumberger, Tamara] Oregon State Univ, Cooperat Inst Marine Resources Studies, Newport, OR USA.\\n   [Baumberger, Tamara] NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, Newport, OR USA.\\n   [Mork, Kjell A.] Inst Marine Res, POB 1870 Nordnes, N-5817 Bergen, Norway.\\n   [Mork, Kjell A.] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, POB 1870 Nordnes, N-5817 Bergen, Norway.\\n   [Lilley, Marvin D.] Univ Washington, Sch Oceanog, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.\\nRP Stensland, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bergen, Dept Earth Sci, KG Jebsen Ctr Deep Sea Res, Ctr Geobiol, Bergen, Norway.\\nEM anne.stensland@uib.no\\nFU Norwegian Research Council (RCN) through the Centre for Geobiology; UiB;\\n   Stiftelsen Kristian Gerard Jebsen [179560]\\nFX We thank W.

The currents are calculated with the 3-D phase-averaged shallow water flow equations, the wave characteristics are determined with a horizontal 2-D wave spectral transformation model, and multiple-sized non-cohesive suspended load and bed load are simulated using a non-equilibrium transport model. The classical mixing length model is modified to determine the horizontal and vertical eddy viscosity considering the effects of current, waves, and wave breaking. A new approach is proposed in the present 3-D model framework to calculate the bed grain shear stress, which is applied to determine the equilibrium bed-load transport rate and near-bed suspended-load concentration. The flow and sediment transport equations are numerically solved using an implicit finite volume method on a hexahedral mesh constructed with horizontal telescoping (quadtree) rectangular cells and vertical sigma coordinate. The difference in the near-bed cells for flow and suspended load calculations is avoided by adding the bed load to the suspended load in the first flow cell above the bed. The developed model has been tested in four laboratory and field cases. It reasonably well reproduces the measured water levels, flow velocities, sediment concentrations, and bed changes.\\nC1 [Wu, Weiming] Clarkson Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Potsdam, NY 13699 USA.\\n   [Lin, Qianru] Microsoft, Redmond, WA 98052 USA.\\nRP Wu, WM (通讯作者)，Clarkson Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Potsdam, NY 13699 USA.\\nEM wwu@clarkson.edu; qianlin@microsoft.com\\nNR 70\\nTC 1\\nZ9 1\\nU1 1\\nU2 6\\nPU SPRINGER HEIDELBERG\\nPI HEIDELBERG\\nPA TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY\\nSN 1616-7341\\nEI 1616-7228\\nJ9 OCEAN DYNAM\\nJI Ocean Dyn.\\nPD MAY\\nPY 2019\\nVL 69\\nIS 5\\nBP 561\\nEP 580\\nDI 10.1007/s10236-019-01261-7\\nPG 20\\nWC Oceanography\\nWE Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)\\nSC Oceanography\\nGA HW2HD\\nUT WOS:000466502900004\\nDA 2022-06-16\\nER\\n\\nPT J\\nAU Lim, DSS\\n   Raineault, NA\\n   Alanis, B\\n   Brier, JA\\n   Chan, E\\n   Emerson, D\\n   Garcia, A\\n   German, CR\\n   Huber, JA\\n   Nawotniak, SK\\n   Milesi, V\\n   Shields, A\\n   Shock, E\\n   Smith, A\\n   Seewald, JS\\n   Trembath-Reichert, E\\n   Mirmalek, Z\\n   Miller, MJ\\n   Cohen, T\\n   Lees, D\\n   Deans, M\\nAF Lim, Darlene S.

Understanding these air-sea interactions is of uttermost importance as the induced atmospheric anomalies partly control the ocean circulation and thus can influence the Earth climate. Whether the TFB and CFB effects can be disentangled, and whether satellite scatterometers can properly reveal them, remain rather unclear. Here, using satellite observations and ocean-atmosphere coupled mesoscale simulations over 45 degrees S to 45 degrees N, we show that the CFB effect can be properly characterized and unraveled from that due to the TFB. We demonstrate that the TFB can be unambiguously characterized by its effect on the stress (and wind) divergence and magnitude. However, its effect on the wind and stress curl is contaminated by the CFB and thus cannot be estimated from scatterometer data. Finally, because scatterometers provide equivalent neutral stability winds relative to the oceanic currents, they cannot characterize adequately the CFB wind response and overestimate the TFB wind response by approximate to 25%. Surface stress appears to be the more appropriate variable to consider from scatterometer data.\\nC1 [Renault, L.] Univ Toulouse, LEGOS, CNRS, IRD,CNES,UPS, Toulouse, France.\\n   [Renault, L.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Los Angeles, CA USA.\\n   [Masson, S.; Colas, F.] Sorbonne Univ UPMC, CNRS, UMR7159, LOCEAN,IPSL,IRD,MNHN, Paris, France.\\n   [Oerder, V.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Escuela Ciencias Mar, Valparaiso, Chile.\\n   [Oerder, V.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Milenio Oceanog, Valparaiso, Chile.\\n   [Oerder, V.] Univ Concepcion, Millennium Inst Oceanog IMO, Concepcion, Chile.\\n   [Jullien, S.] Univ Brest, IFREMER, Lab Oceanog Phys & Spatiale, CNRS,IRD,IUEM, Brest, France.\\nRP Renault, L (通讯作者)，Univ Toulouse, LEGOS, CNRS, IRD,CNES,UPS, Toulouse, France.; Renault, L (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Los Angeles, CA USA.\\nEM lionel.renault@ird.fr\\nRI masson, sebastien/F-9780-2011; Colas, Francois/B-4920-2012; Jullien,\\n   Swen/L-5610-2015\\nOI masson, sebastien/0000-0002-1694-8117; Colas,\\n   Francois/0000-0002-5859-6586; Renault, Lionel/0000-0002-3001-2091;\\n   Jullien, Swen/0000-0002-5389-0532; Oerder, Vera/0000-0001-7653-4154\\nFU National Science Foundation [OCE-1419450]; GENCI-TGCC computing\\n   resources GENCI-TGCC [2017-0106895 2018-0106895 A0050107298];\\n   Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE); French National Research\\n   Agency (ANR) [ANR-11-MONU-0010]; FONDECYT [3180472]\\nFX We appreciate support from the National Science Foundation\\n   (OCE-1419450).

The two surface forcing processes, a result of turbulent atmospheric flow over waves, are boundary conditions for momentum transfer into the water column. The surface energy flux related to form drag is that which drives surface waves. As in other fluid dynamic flows where viscous and/or pressure stresses are involved, one supposes there exists a relevant Reynolds number. In this paper, we begin with the rather definitive near-wall data of Nikuradse, governed by a wall Reynolds number, and progress to equations useful for air flow over ocean surface waves for which reference is made to a consensus of formulas, resident in the literature, for drag coefficient versus wind speed. The processes of momentum transfer and the transfer of heat and water vapor across the air-sea interface differ. The governing equations of the latter scalar quantities do not contain pressure, and therefore, form drag is excluded. A detailed study of bulk coefficients for heat and water vapor transfer which includes low wind speed show that the bulk coefficients are nearly constants as a function of wind speed in accordance with observations. For greatest precision, neutral bulk coefficients presented here should be corrected for density stratification (Large and Pond 1982).\\nC1 [Mellor, George] Princeton Univ, Program Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Sayre Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.\\nRP Mellor, G (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Program Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Sayre Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.\\nEM glmellor@princeton.edu\\nNR 29\\nTC 1\\nZ9 1\\nU1 0\\nU2 1\\nPU SPRINGER HEIDELBERG\\nPI HEIDELBERG\\nPA TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY\\nSN 1616-7341\\nEI 1616-7228\\nJ9 OCEAN DYNAM\\nJI Ocean Dyn.\\nPD JAN\\nPY 2019\\nVL 69\\nIS 1\\nBP 43\\nEP 50\\nDI 10.1007/s10236-018-1228-7\\nPG 8\\nWC Oceanography\\nWE Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)\\nSC Oceanography\\nGA HH1VH\\nUT WOS:000455507500004\\nDA 2022-06-16\\nER\\n\\nPT B\\nAU Whitehead, JA\\nAF Whitehead, J.

Here we explore, in a field-based study, possible pathways for sediment movement adjacent to Point Dume, a headland in Santa Monica Bay, California. This prominent shoreline feature is a nearly symmetrical, triangular shaped promontory interior to the Santa Monica Littoral Cell. We collected current, wave, and turbidity data for 74 days during which several wave events occurred, including one associated with a remote hurricane and another generated by the first winter storm of 2014. We also acquired sediment samples to quantify seabed grain-size distributions. Near-bottom currents towards the headland dominated on both of its sides and wave driven longshore currents in the surf zone were faster on the exposed side. Bed shear stresses were generated mostly by waves with minor contributions from currents, but both wave-driven and other currents contributed to sediment flux. On the wave-exposed west side of the headland, suspended sediment concentrations correlated with bed stress suggesting local resuspension whereas turbidity levels on the sheltered east side of the headland are more easily explained by advective delivery. Most of the suspended sediment appears to be exported offshore due to flow separation at the apex of the headland but may not move far given that sediment fluxes at moorings offshore of the apex were small. Further, wave-driven sediment flux in the surf zone is unlikely to pass the headland due to the discontinuity in wave forcing that causes longshore transport in different directions on each side of the headland. It is thus unlikely that sand is transported past the headland (specifically in a westerly direction), although some transport of finer fractions may occur offshore in deep water. These findings of minimal sediment flux past Point Dume are consistent with its role as a littoral cell boundary, although more complex multi-stage processes and unusual events may account for some transport at times.\\nC1 [George, Douglas A.; Largier, John L.; Gaylord, Brian] Univ Calif Davis, Bodega Marine Lab, Davis, CA 95616 USA.\\n   [Storlazzi, Curt D.] US Geol Survey, Santa Cruz, CA USA.\\n   [Robart, Matthew J.] Occidental Coll, Vantuna Res Grp, Los Angeles, CA 90041 USA.\\nRP George, DA (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Bodega Marine Lab, Davis, CA 95616 USA.\\nEM dgeorge@ucdavis.edu\\nFU USC Sea Grant Program, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,\\n   U.S. Department of Commerce [NA14OAR4170089]\\nFX The authors wish to thank the following individuals for assistance in\\n   preparing for and conducting field work in Malibu: David Dann (BML), Tom\\n   Ford (The Bay Foundation), and Patrick Barnard, Dan Hoover, Tim Elfers,\\n   Andrew Stevens, and Jackson Curry (all USGS).

Its causes, of natural or anthropogenic nature, are still unclear. Based on 7years of continuous acoustic recordings at widespread sites in the southern Indian Ocean, we show that this observation stands for five populations of large whales. The frequency of selected units of vocalizations of fin, Antarctic, and pygmy blue whales has steadily decreased at a rate of a few tenths of hertz per year since 2002. In addition to this interannual frequency decrease, blue whale vocalizations display seasonal frequency shifts. We show that these intra-annual shifts correlate with seasonal changes in the ambient noise near their call frequency. This ambient noise level, in turn, shows a strong correlation with the seasonal presence of icebergs, which are one of the main sources of oceanic noise in the Southern Hemisphere. Although cause-and-effect relationships are difficult to ascertain, wide-ranging changes in the acoustic environment seem to have a strong impact on the vocal behavior of large baleen whales. Seasonal frequency shifts may be due to short-term changes in the ambient noise, and the interannual frequency decline to long-term changes in the acoustic properties of the ocean and/or in postwhaling changes in whale abundances.\\n   Plain Language Summary In the past decades, a progressive decrease in the frequencies of blue whale vocalizations is observed worldwide. Its causes,of natural or anthropogenic nature, are unclear. Based on 7years of widespread acoustic records in the southern Indian Ocean, we show that the call frequency of five populations of large baleen whales decreases at a constant rate of tenths of hertz per year. We also found that seasonal shifts in the whale call frequency follow seasonal changes in the ambient noise in the same frequency band. Wide-ranging changes in the acoustic environment have thus a strong impact on the vocal behavior of large whales in the short term, but, paradoxically, not in the long term.\\nC1 [Leroy, Emmanuelle C.; Royer, Jean-Yves] Univ Brest, Plouzane, France.\\n   [Leroy, Emmanuelle C.; Royer, Jean-Yves] CNRS, Lab Geosci Ocean, IUEM, Plouzane, France.\\n   [Bonnel, Julien] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Falmouth, MA USA.\\n   [Samaran, Flore] ENSTA Bretagne, UMR CNRS 6285, Lab STICC, Brest, France.\\nRP Leroy, EC (通讯作者)，Univ Brest, Plouzane, France.; Leroy, EC (通讯作者)，CNRS, Lab Geosci Ocean, IUEM, Plouzane, France.\\nEM emmanuelle.leroy@unsw.edu.au\\nRI Leroy, Emmanuelle/Q-9995-2019; Royer, Jean-Yves/B-4312-2010\\nOI Leroy, Emmanuelle/0000-0002-6469-1758; Royer,\\n   Jean-Yves/0000-0002-7653-7715\\nFU French Polar Institute (IPEV); INSU-CNRS; University of Brest; Regional\\n   Council of Brittany (Conseil Regional de Bretagne)\\nFX The authors wish to thank the Captains and crews of RV Marion Dufresne\\n   for the successful deployments and recoveries of the hydrophones of the\\n   DEFLOHYDRO (Royer, 2008) and OHASISBIO (Royer, 2009) experiments.

Model outputs show that mean circulation is anticyclonic around the ridge segment, which consists of a northward flow along the western flank and a southward flow along the eastern flank. Those flank jets are dispersal expressways for the along-ridge larval transport and strongly affect its overall direction and spatial-temporal variations. It is evident from model results that the transform faults bounding the ridge segment and off axis topography (the Lamont Seamount Chain) act as topographic barriers to larval dispersal in the along-ridge direction. Furthermore, the presence of an overlapping spreading center and an adjacent local topographic high impedes the southward along-ridge larval transport. The model results suggest that larval recolonization within ridge-crest habitats is enhanced by the anticyclonic circulation around the ridge segment, and the overall recolonization rate is higher for larvae having a short precompetency period and an altitude above the bottom sufficient to avoid influence by the near-bottom currents Surprisingly, for larvae having a long precompetency period (>10days), the prolonged travel time allowed some of those larvae to return to their natal vent clusters, which results in an unexpected increase in connectivity among natal and neighboring sites. Overall, model-based predictions of connectivity are highly sensitive to the larval precompetency period and vertical position in the water column.\\n   Plain Language Summary In this study, we use state-of-the-art computer simulations to investigate how ocean currents transport larvae of animals living in hydrothermal vent fields on the crest of the East Pacific Rise ridge located at over 2,000m below the surface of the Northeast Pacific. Our study provides an in-depth look into how currents, seafloor topography, and physiological traits of larvae influence the biological connectivity among different habitats on a segment of the East Pacific Rise. Our simulations suggest that ocean currents form a clockwise circulation around the ridge segment, which consists of a northward flow along the western flank and a southward flow along the eastern flank. Those flows, which we call flank jets, are expressways for larval transport along the ridge and largely control the overall direction of that transport. Our simulations also suggest that large faults at the ends of the ridge segments disrupt the movement of larvae along the ridge and reduce their chance of reaching habitats located on adjacent segments. On the other hand, the presence of the clockwise circulation enhances larval connectivity among habitats within the same segment, especially for larvae that mature quickly and spend their lifetime at higher altitudes above the seafloor.\\nC1 [Xu, Guangyu] Univ Washington, Appl Phys Lab, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.\\n   [McGillicuddy, D.

Observations from moorings across the current and a 22-year proxy of Agulhas Current volume transport reveal that the current is over 25% stronger in austral summer than in winter. We hypothesize that winds over the Southern Indian Ocean play a critical role in determining this seasonal phasing through barotropic and first baroclinic mode adjustments and communication to the western boundary via Rossby waves. Our hypothesis is explored using single-layer and one-and-a-half layer models. We find that the barotropic contribution to seasonal phasing is small, with the majority of the seasonal signal deflected offshore and along the Mozambique Ridge. The summertime maximum and wintertime minimum can, however, be reproduced by a one-and-a-half layer reduced gravity model in which adjustment time to wind forcing via Rossby waves is in line with observations from satellite altimetry. Additionally, near-field winds (to the west of 35 degrees E) are shown to have a controlling influence on the seasonal phasing, as signals from farther afield dissipate through destructive interference with overlying winds before reaching the western boundary. These results suggest a critical role for a baroclinic adjustment to near-field winds in setting the summertime maximum in Agulhas Current transport.\\n   The Agulhas Current flows along the east coast of South Africa, transporting warm Indian Ocean water southward, acting as a vital limb of the global ocean conveyor belt and influencing local rainfall and climate. This study looks at the seasonal cycle of the Agulhas Current and uses idealized models to explore how winds over the Southern Indian Ocean may influence this seasonality. The current is 25% stronger in summertime, yet we do not have existing knowledge regarding the principal drivers that set this observed variability. In this study, we find that baroclinic processes communicating the wind stress curl variability from near-field winds have a dominant contribution to the seasonal phasing. Wind signals from further afield are found to die out during their journey west and so have little effect on the seasonal cycle of the Agulhas Current. Furthermore, correctly capturing the adjustment time to wind forcing is found to be very important when endeavoring to simulate the Agulhas Current seasonal phasing using a reduced gravity model. This study exposes a link between the seasonality of Agulhas Current and propagation of first baroclinic mode Rossby waves communicating the near-field wind stress signal across the western portion of the Southern Indian Ocean.\\nC1 [Hutchinson, Katherine; Ansorge, Isabelle; Hermes, Juliet] Univ Cape Town, Dept Oceanog, Cape Town, South Africa.\\n   [Hutchinson, Katherine; Hermes, Juliet] SAEON Egagasini Node, South African Environm Observat Network, Cape Town, South Africa.\\n   [Beal, Lisa M.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA.\\n   [Penven, Pierrick] Univ Brest, Lab Oceanog Phys & Spatiale, CNRS, IFREMER,IRD,IUEM, Brest, France.\\nRP Hutchinson, K (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Dept Oceanog, Cape Town, South Africa.; Hutchinson, K (通讯作者)，SAEON Egagasini Node, South African Environm Observat Network, Cape Town, South Africa.\\nEM kath.hutchinson@gmail.com\\nRI ANSORGE, ISABELLE/AAY-7396-2020; Penven, Pierrick/A-6665-2008\\nOI Penven, Pierrick/0000-0001-6456-3142; Beal, Lisa/0000-0003-3678-5367;\\n   Hutchinson, Katherine/0000-0002-3472-8273\\nFU South African National Research Fund (DST-NRF PDP Professional\\n   Development Grant) [88741]; South African Environmental Observations\\n   Network (SAEON); South African National Antarctic Programme (SANAP)\\n   [466311]; French Institut de recherche pour le developpement (IRD)\\n   [426213 CMS 1039]; South African National Research fund KIC award\\n   [111529]; U.S. National Science Foundation (U.S. NSF) [1459543]; Cnes\\nFX The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support necessary to\\n   carry out this research provided by the South African National Research\\n   Fund (DST-NRF PDP Professional Development Grant 88741) and the South\\n   African Environmental Observations Network (SAEON).

New 2015-16 mooring data from beneath Petermann Gletscher\\'s ice shelf imply a continued warming of 0.025 degrees +/- 0.013 degrees C yr(-1) with a modest seasonal signal. In 2015, we measured ocean temperatures of 0.28 degrees C near the grounding line of Petermann Gletscher\\'s ice shelf, which drove submarine melting along the base of the glacier. The resultant meltwater contributed to ocean stratification, which forced a stronger geostrophic circulation at the ice shelf terminus compared with previous years. This increased both the freshwater flux away from the sub-ice shelf cavity and the heat flux into it. Net summertime geostrophic heat flux estimates into the sub-ice shelf cavity exceed the requirement for steady-state melting of Petermann Gletscher\\'s ice shelf. Likewise, freshwater fluxes away from the glacier exceed the expected steady-state meltwater discharge. These results suggest that the warmer, more active ocean surrounding Petermann Gletscher forces non steady state melting of its ice shelf. When sustained, such melting thins the ice shelf.\\nC1 [Washam, P.; Munchow, A.] Univ Delaware, Coll Earth Ocean & Environm, Newark, DE 19716 USA.\\n   [Nicholls, K.

The rings transport warm and salty waters that feed the surface limb of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. Early studies suggest that Agulhas rings decay and diffuse their contents within the South Atlantic subtropical gyre. In this paper, we update the ring census using an automated algorithm to detect and track eddies over more than 23 years of satellite altimetry data (1993-2016) and calculate their main characteristics. While 140 rings spawned from the Agulhas Retroflection, their following splitting and merging resulted in 74 long-lived rings that crossed the Walvis Ridge and translated towards the west. Eventually, three rings reached the western boundary. For one of them, we use in situ measurements to document its interaction with the Brazil Current and two cyclonic eddies, which resulted in a current velocity increase by three times. Although already hypothesized, this interaction had not been demonstrated with in situ evidence until now.\\nC1 [Guerra, Luiz Alexandre A.; Paiva, Afonso M.] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, COPPE, Programa Engn Ocean PEnO, Ctr Tecnol, Bl C Sala 203,Caixa Postal 68508,Cidade Univ, BR-21949900 Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.\\n   [Guerra, Luiz Alexandre A.] PETROBRAS CENPES, Av Horacio Macedo 950,Cidade Univ, BR-21941915 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.\\n   [Chassignet, Eric P.] Florida State Univ, COAPS, 2000 Levy Ave, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.\\nRP Guerra, LAA (通讯作者)，PETROBRAS CENPES, Av Horacio Macedo 950,Cidade Univ, BR-21941915 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.\\nEM laguerra@petrobras.com.br\\nRI de Moraes Paiva, Afonso/AAI-2557-2020\\nOI de Moraes Paiva, Afonso/0000-0002-2559-6037; Guerra, Luiz\\n   Alexandre/0000-0002-5223-0612\\nFU CNPq (National Council for Scientific and Technological Development,\\n   Brazil); NSF (National Science Foundation, USA) [0928271]\\nFX The authors thank Queiroz Galvao Exploracao e Producao S.A., OGX\\n   Petroleo e Gas Participacoes S.A., and Barra Energia do Brasil Petroleo\\n   e Gas Ltda. for permitting the use of the mooring data in this\\n   publication.

Due to technological challenges of sampling and observation at such extreme depths, these trenches are one of the least exploited habitats on our planet. Recent findings show high sedimentation rates, high biomass, intense microbial activity and chemosynthetic communities in hadal trenches, suggesting that they may play a more important role in global ocean biogeochemical cycles than previously recognized. Here we review the hadal biogeochemistry in four aspects: food supply and its effect on hadal life; hadal carbon cycle; microbial-mediated stable carbon isotope fractionation in biosynthesis of lipids under high hydrostatic pressures; and pollution in the hadal trenches. Our current knowledge of hadal biogeochemistry is rudimentary and many fundamental questions remain to be answered. However, with the rapid development of the full-ocean-depth exploration and sampling technologies, it is very likely hadal scientists will make significant breakthroughs in hadal biogeochemistry research in the coming decades.\\nC1 [Xu, Yunping; Ge, Huangmin; Fang, Jiasong] Shanghai Ocean Univ, Coll Marine Sci, Shanghai Engn Res Ctr Hadal Sci & Technol, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China.\\n   [Fang, Jiasong] Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Marine Biol & Biotechnol, Qingdao 266237, Peoples R China.\\n   [Fang, Jiasong] Hawaii Pacific Univ, Coll Nat & Computat Sci, Honolulu, HI 96813 USA.\\nRP Fang, JS (通讯作者)，Shanghai Ocean Univ, Coll Marine Sci, Shanghai Engn Res Ctr Hadal Sci & Technol, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China.\\nEM jfang@shou.edu.cn\\nRI Xu, Yunping/F-8042-2011; , 许云平/AAI-2618-2020\\nOI Xu, Yunping/0000-0001-5693-7239; \\nFU Shanghai Committee of Science and Technology [14DZ1205501, 14DZ2250900,\\n   15DZ1207000]; National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFC0310600];\\n   National Natural Science Foundation of China [41773069]\\nFX This work is financially supported by the Shanghai Committee of Science\\n   and Technology (14DZ1205501, 14DZ2250900, 15DZ1207000).

The presence of four canyons: Avon, Mahin, Benin, and Escravos, are confirmed from the multi-beam data map and identified as cutting across the shelf and slope areas, with morphological features ranging from axial channels, moderate to high sinuosity indices, scarps, terraces and nickpoints which are interpreted as resulting from erosional and depositional activities within and around the canyons. The Avon Canyon, in particular, is characterised by various branches and sub-branches with complex morphologies. The canyons are mostly U-shaped in these lower parts with occasional V-shapes down their courses. Their typical orientation is NE-SW. Sedimentary processes are proposed as being a major controlling factor in these canyons. Sediments appear to have been discharged directly into the canyons by rivers during the late Quaternary low sea level which allows river mouths to extend as far as the shelf edge. The current sediment supply is still primarily sourced from these rivers in the case of the Benin and Escravos Canyons, but indirectly in the case of the Avon and Mahin Canyons where the rivers discharge sediments into the lagoons and the lagoons bring the sediments on to the continental shelf before they are dispersed into the canyon heads. Ancient canyons that have long been buried underneath the Avon Canyon are identified in the multichannel seismic profile across the head of the Avon Canyon, while a number of normal faults around the walls of the Avon and Mahin Canyons are observed in the selected sub-bottom profiles. The occurrence of these faults, especially in the irregular portions of the canyon walls, suggests that they also have some effect on the canyon architecture. The formation of the canyons is attributed to the exposure of the upper marginal area to incisions from erosion during the sea level lowstand of the glacial period. The incisions are widened and lengthened by contouric currents, turbidity currents and slope failures resulting in the canyons.\\nC1 [Jimoh, Rasheed Olayinka; Akinnigbage, Edward Akintoye; Adeleye, Adedayo Oluwaseun] Zhejiang Univ, Ocean Coll, Zhoushan 316021, Peoples R China.\\n   [Jimoh, Rasheed Olayinka; Tang Yong; Li Jiabiao; Li He; Akinnigbage, Edward Akintoye; Adeleye, Adedayo Oluwaseun] State Ocean Adm, Inst Oceanog 2, Hangzhou 310012, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.\\n   [Jimoh, Rasheed Olayinka; Tang Yong; Li He] State Ocean Adm, Key Lab Submarine Geosci, Hangzhou 310012, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.\\n   [Jimoh, Rasheed Olayinka; Akinnigbage, Edward Akintoye; Adeleye, Adedayo Oluwaseun] Nigerian Inst Oceanog & Marine Res, Lagos 12729, PMB, Nigeria.\\n   [Awosika, Larry Folajimi] Commiss Limits Continental Shelf, Div Ocean Affairs & Law Sea, New York, NY 11101 USA.\\nRP Tang, Y (通讯作者)，State Ocean Adm, Inst Oceanog 2, Hangzhou 310012, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.; Tang, Y (通讯作者)，State Ocean Adm, Key Lab Submarine Geosci, Hangzhou 310012, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.\\nEM tangyong@sio.org.cn\\nFU National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFC1405504]; National Natural\\n   Science Foundation of China [41470648]; Public Science and Technology\\n   Research Funds Projects of Ocean [201205003]; National Program on Global\\n   Change and Air-Sea Interaction, SOA [631 GASI-GEOGE-01]\\nFX The National Key R&D Program of China under contract NO. 2017YFC1405504;\\n   the National Natural Science Foundation of China under contract No.\\n   41470648; the Public Science and Technology Research Funds Projects of\\n   Ocean under contract No. 201205003; the National Program on Global\\n   Change and Air-Sea Interaction, SOA under contract No. 631\\n   GASI-GEOGE-01.\\nNR 41\\nTC 1\\nZ9 2\\nU1 0\\nU2 4\\nPU SPRINGER\\nPI NEW YORK\\nPA 233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA\\nSN 0253-505X\\nEI 1869-1099\\nJ9 ACTA OCEANOL SIN\\nJI Acta Oceanol.

Yet, the taxonomic resolution of the diets of these important fishes is often limited, especially in the Northwest Atlantic. We examined the diets, along with stable isotope signatures, of five dominant small pelagic species of the northeast US continental shelf ecosystem (Atlantic mackerel Scomber scombrus, Atlantic herring Clupea harengus, alewife Alosa pseudoharengus, blueback herring Alosa aestivalis, and Atlantic butterfish Peprilus triacanthus). Diet analyses revealed strong seasonal differences in most species. Small pelagic fishes predominantly consumed Calanus copepods, small copepod genera (Pseudocalanus/Paracalanus/Clausocalanus), and Centropages copepods in the spring, with appendicularians also important by number for most species. Krill, primarily Meganyctiphanes norvegica, and hyperiid amphipods of the genera Hyperia and Parathemisto were common in the stomach contents of four of the five species in the fall, with hyperiids common in the stomach contents of butterfish in both seasons and krill common in the stomach contents of alewife in both seasons. Depth and region were also found to be sources of variability in the diets of Atlantic mackerel, Atlantic herring, and alewife (region but not depth) with krill being more often in the diet of alewife in more northerly locations, primarily the Gulf of Maine. Stable isotope data corroborate the seasonal differences in diet but overlap of isotopic niche space contrasts that of dietary overlap, highlighting the differences in the two methods. Overall, the seasonal variability and consumer specific diets of small pelagic fishes are important for understanding how changes in the zooplankton community could influence higher trophic levels.\\nC1 [Suca, Justin J.; Pringle, Julie W.; Knorek, Zofia R.; Hamilton, Sara L.; Llopiz, Joel K.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Biol Dept, 266 Woods Hole Rd, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\n   [Suca, Justin J.] MIT WHOI Joint Program Oceanog, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\n   [Pringle, Julie W.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Marine Sci, 1080 Shennecossett Rd, Groton, CT 06340 USA.\\n   [Knorek, Zofia R.] Univ Oregon, Oregon Inst Marine Biol, POB 5389, Charleston, OR 97420 USA.\\n   [Hamilton, Sara L.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, 3029 Cordley Hall, Corvallis, OR 97330 USA.\\n   [Richardson, David E.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Northeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, 28 Tarzwell Dr, Narragansett, RI 02882 USA.\\nRP Llopiz, JK (通讯作者)，Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Biol Dept, 266 Woods Hole Rd, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\nEM jllopiz@whoi.edu\\nOI Hamilton, Sara/0000-0002-0156-7610; Llopiz, Joel/0000-0002-7584-7471\\nFU US National Science Foundation (NSF) OCE-RIG grant [OCE 1325451]; NOAA\\n   through the Cooperative Institute for the North Atlantic Region (CINAR)\\n   in the form a CINAR Fellow Award [NA14OAR4320158]; NSF Long-term\\n   Ecological Research grant for the Northeast US Shelf Ecosystem [OCE\\n   1655686]; Hendrix College summer research award; NSF REU; Directorate\\n   For Geosciences [1325451] Funding Source: National Science Foundation\\nFX This work would not have been possible without the samples provided by\\n   NOAA\\'s Northeast Fisheries Science Center, specifically including Jakub\\n   Kircun and the many other scientists and crewmembers on the NOAAS Henry\\n   B.

Activities in the central Arctic have increased from 2007 through 2011 to 2015. The increased Ra-228 input is attributed to stronger wave action on shelves resulting from a longer ice-free season. A concomitant decrease in the Th-228/Ra-228 ratio likely results from more rapid transit of surface waters depleted in Th-228 by scavenging over the shelf. The Ra-228 activities observed in intermediate waters (<1,500 m) in the Amundsen Basin are explained by ventilation with shelf water on a time scale of about 15-18 years, in good agreement with estimates based on SF6 and I-129/U-236. The Th-228 excess below the mixed layer up to 1,500m depth can complement Th-234 and Po-210 as tracers of export production, after correction for the inherent excess resulting from the similarity of Ra-228 and Th-228 decay times. We show with a Th/Ra profile model that the Th-228/Ra-228 ratio below 1,500m is inappropriate for this purpose because it is a delicate balance between horizontal supply of Ra-228 and vertical flux of particulate Th-228. The accumulation of Ra-226 in the deep Makarov Basin is not associated with an accumulation of Ba and can therefore be attributed to supply from decay of Th-230 in the bottom sediment. We estimate a ventilation time of 480 years for the deep Makarov-Canada Basin, in good agreement with previous estimates using other tracers.\\nC1 [van der Loeff, Michiel Rutgers; Stimac, Ingrid; Valk, Ole; Karcher, Michael; Krumpen, Thomas] Alfred Wegener Inst, Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Bremerhaven, Germany.\\n   [Kipp, Lauren; Charette, Matthew A.; Black, Erin] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Marine Chem & Geochem, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\n   [Moore, Willard S.] Univ South Carolina, Dept Earth & Ocean Sci, Columbia, SC USA.\\n   [Charkin, Alexander] Russian Acad Sci FEBRAS, Russian Acad Sci, Far Eastern Branch, Pacific Oceanol Inst POI, Vladivostok, Russia.\\n   [Bauch, Dorothea] GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, Kiel, Germany.\\n   [Casacuberta, Nuria] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Lab Ion Beam Phys, Zurich, Switzerland.\\n   [Casacuberta, Nuria] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Biogeochem & Pollutant Dynam, Environm Phys, Zurich, Switzerland.\\n   [Smethie, William] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, New York, NY USA.\\n   [Rember, Robert] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Int Arctic Res Ctr, Fairbanks, AK USA.\\nRP van der Loeff, MR (通讯作者)，Alfred Wegener Inst, Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Bremerhaven, Germany.\\nEM mloeff@awi.de\\nRI Krumpen, Thomas/D-5163-2011; Casacuberta, Nuria/AAS-2189-2020; Charkin,\\n   Alexander/G-8883-2019; Moore, Willard S/B-6096-2016; Charette,\\n   Matthew/I-9495-2012\\nOI Krumpen, Thomas/0000-0001-6234-8756; Casacuberta,\\n   Nuria/0000-0001-7316-1655; Moore, Willard S/0000-0001-5930-5325; Stimac,\\n   Ingrid/0000-0001-6053-2330; Black, Erin/0000-0003-2781-7531; Charkin,\\n   Alexander/0000-0001-9273-9950; Kipp, Lauren/0000-0002-5111-9779; Bauch,\\n   Dorothea/0000-0002-1419-9714; Rutgers van der Loeff,\\n   Michiel/0000-0003-1393-3742; Karcher, Michael/0000-0002-9587-811X\\nFU U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-1458305, OCE-1458424,\\n   OCE-1433922]; Directorate For Geosciences [1433922] Funding Source:\\n   National Science Foundation\\nFX We thank captain Schwarze with his crew of RV Polarstern and captain and\\n   crew of USCSC Healy for making this joint GEOTRACES study in the central\\n   Arctic Ocean a success.

Surface oil patches have been persistently observed within this site since 2004, when an oil rig was destroyed by Hurricane Ivan. A multiplatform observational experiment was conducted in April 2017 to investigate, for the first time, the main hydrocarbon pathways from the Taylor Energy Site toward the NGoM continental shelves, and the Gulf interior, under the influence of local and regional physical processes. Results indicate that the Mississippi River (MR)-induced fronts over the Taylor Energy Site, in combination with local circulation, prevailing winds and broader regional dynamics determine the hydrocarbon transport. The drifters deployed during the field experiment, in tandem with satellite data, drone imagery, wind measurements, and radar-derived data, efficiently described three major hydrocarbon pathways, associated with MR plume dynamics (downstream/upstream coastal currents) and basin-wide circulation (offshore pathway). Two different types of drifters, drogued and undrogued, showed clearly different pathways, which suggest potential differences in the expected advection of oil, depending on whether it forms a surface slick or whether it is partially mixed below the surface. The existence of multiple river fronts influenced the fate of oiled waters, preventing the hydrocarbons from reaching the Delta, like a natural boom barrier, trapping and directing the oil either westward or eastward. Thermohaline measurements showed that the MR plume near Taylor was 5-10 m deep, while the clearer ocean was characterized by a 40 m upper ocean homogenous layer.\\nC1 [Androulidakis, Yannis; Kourafalou, Vassiliki; Oezgoekmen, Tamay; Lund, Bjoern; Haus, Brian K.; Novelli, Guillaume; Guigand, Cedric; Kang, HeeSook] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Dept Ocean Sci, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA.\\n   [Garcia-Pineda, Oscar] WaterMapping LLC, Gulf Breeze, FL USA.\\n   [Le Henaff, Matthieu] Univ Miami, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies Miami, Miami Beach, FL USA.\\n   [Le Henaff, Matthieu] NOAA, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Miami, FL 33149 USA.\\n   [Hu, Chuanmin] Univ S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, St Petersburg, FL USA.\\n   [Hole, Lars] Norwegian Meteorol Inst, Div Oceanog & Marine Meteorol, Bergen, Norway.\\n   [Horstmann, Jochen] Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Geesthacht, Germany.\\nRP Androulidakis, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Dept Ocean Sci, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA.\\nEM iandroul@rsmas.miami.edu\\nRI Androulidakis, Yannis/AAL-4392-2021; Le Hénaff, Matthieu/P-8480-2018;\\n   Hu, Chuanmin/AAB-9604-2021\\nOI Hu, Chuanmin/0000-0003-3949-6560; Novelli,\\n   Guillaume/0000-0001-9560-7304; Horstmann, Jochen/0000-0002-7979-5736;\\n   Androulidakis, Yannis/0000-0002-7005-3963; Haus,\\n   Brian/0000-0003-1372-5628; Lund, Bjorn/0000-0002-9440-3825; Kourafalou,\\n   Villy/0000-0002-6434-4027\\nFU Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative [GOMA 23160700]; Physical\\n   Oceanography Division at NOAA\\'s Atlantic Oceanographic and\\n   Meteorological Laboratory, AOML; Research Council of Norway [244262]\\nFX This research was made possible by two grants from The Gulf of Mexico\\n   Research Initiative (award \"Influence of river induced fronts on\\n   hydrocarbon transport,\\'\\' GOMA 23160700 and award \"Consortium for\\n   Advanced Research on Transport of Hydrocarbon in the Environment,\\'\\'\\n   CARTHE).

Pure Appl Geophys 173(12):3895-3934, 2016a, 174(1): 3003-3028, 2017). Unlike standard algorithms that detect surface current patterns, the TCA is based on analyzing space-time correlations of radar signal time series in pairs of radar cells, which does not require inverting radial surface currents. This was done by calculating a contrast function, which quantifies the change in pattern of the mean correlation between pairs of neighboring cells upon tsunami arrival, with respect to a reference correlation computed in the recent past. In earlier work, the TCA was successfully validated based on realistic numerical simulations of both the radar signal and tsunami wave trains. Here, this algorithm is adapted to apply to actual data from a HF radar installed in Tofino, BC, for three test cases: (1) a simulated far-field tsunami generated in the Semidi Subduction Zone in the Aleutian Arc; (2) a simulated near-field tsunami from a submarine mass failure on the continental slope off of Tofino; and (3) an event believed to be a meteotsunami, which occurred on October 14th, 2016, off of the Pacific West Coast and was measured by the radar. In the first two cases, the synthetic tsunami signal is superimposed onto the radar signal by way of a current memory term; in the third case, the tsunami signature is present within the radar data. In light of these test cases, we develop a detection methodology based on the TCA, using a correlation contrast function, and show that in all three cases the algorithm is able to trigger a timely early warning.\\nC1 [Guerin, Charles-Antoine] Aix Marseille Univ, Univ Toulon, CNRS IRD, MIO UM110, La Garde, France.\\n   [Grilli, Stephan T.; Moran, Patrick; Grilli, Annette R.] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Ocean Engn, Narragansett, RI 02882 USA.\\n   [Insua, Tania L.] ONC, 2300 McKenzie Ave, Victoria, BC VBW 2Y2, Canada.\\nRP Guerin, CA (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Univ, Univ Toulon, CNRS IRD, MIO UM110, La Garde, France.\\nEM guerin@univ-tln.fr; grilli@uri.edu; patrick_moran@my.uri.edu;\\n   annette_grilli@uri.edu; tinsua@uvic.ca\\nRI GUERIN, Charles-Antoine/AAE-7038-2021\\nOI Insua, Tania L./0000-0002-3070-2332\\nFU Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn [1537568] Funding Source:\\n   National Science Foundation\\nNR 41\\nTC 11\\nZ9 11\\nU1 0\\nU2 6\\nPU SPRINGER HEIDELBERG\\nPI HEIDELBERG\\nPA TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY\\nSN 1616-7341\\nEI 1616-7228\\nJ9 OCEAN DYNAM\\nJI Ocean Dyn.\\nPD MAY\\nPY 2018\\nVL 68\\nIS 4-5\\nBP 423\\nEP 438\\nDI 10.1007/s10236-018-1139-7\\nPG 16\\nWC Oceanography\\nWE Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)\\nSC Oceanography\\nGA GD5YU\\nUT WOS:000430585900001\\nOA Green Submitted\\nDA 2022-06-16\\nER\\n\\nPT J\\nAU Shrestha, K\\n   Anderson, W\\n   Kuehl, J\\nAF Shrestha, Kalyan\\n   Anderson, William\\n   Kuehl, Joseph\\nTI Langmuir Turbulence in Coastal Zones: Structure and Length Scales\\nSO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY\\nLA English\\nDT Article\\nID LARGE-EDDY SIMULATION; K-PROFILE PARAMETERIZATION; SURFACE\\n   BOUNDARY-LAYER; OCEANIC MIXED-LAYER; SHALLOW-WATER; AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHS;\\n   WALL TURBULENCE; SECONDARY FLOWS; CIRCULATION; WIND\\nAB Langmuir turbulence is a boundary layer oceanographic phenomenon of the upper layer that is relevant to mixing and vertical transport capacity. It is a manifestation of imposed aerodynamic stresses and the aggregate horizontal velocity profile due to orbital wave motion (the so-called Stokes profile), resulting in streamwise-elongated, counterrotating cells. The majority of previous research on Langmuir turbulence has focused on the open ocean. Here, we investigate the characteristics of coastal Langmuir turbulence by solving the grid-filtered Craik-Leibovich equations where the distinction between open and coastal conditions is a product of additional bottom boundary layer shear. Studies are elucidated by visualizing Langmuir cell vortices using isosurfaces of Q. We show that different environmental forcing conditions control the length scales of coastal Langmuir cells. We have identified regimes where increasing the Stokes drift velocity and decreasing surface wind stress both act to change the horizontal size of coastal Langmuir cells. Furthermore, wavenumber is also responsible in setting the horizontal extent L-s of Langmuir cells. Along with that, wavenumber that is linked to the Stokes depth delta(s) controls the vertical extent L-h(ssv) of small-scale vortices embedded within the upwelling limb, while the downwelling limb occupies the depth of the water column H for any coastal surface wave forcing (i.e., L-h(d) - H and L-h(ssv) similar to delta(s)). Additional simulations are included to demonstrate insensitivity to the grid resolution and aspect ratio.\\nC1 [Shrestha, Kalyan; Anderson, William] Univ Texas Dallas, Mech Engn Dept, Richardson, TX 75083 USA.\\n   [Kuehl, Joseph] Univ Delaware, Dept Mech Engn, Newark, DE 19716 USA.\\nRP Shrestha, K (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Dallas, Mech Engn Dept, Richardson, TX 75083 USA.\\nEM kxs160530@utdallas.edu\\nFU Texas General Land Office, Oil Spill Program under TGLO Contract\\n   [16-019-0009283]\\nFX This work was supported by the Texas General Land Office, Oil Spill\\n   Program (Program Manager: Steve Buschang) under TGLO Contract\\n   16-019-0009283.

Satellite observations revealed 41 strong MISO events that initiated over the central equatorial Indian Ocean and propagated northward to the Indian subcontinent and/or eastward to the Maritime Continent during the May-October season of the 2001-2012 period. Eight of those events were preceded by SSTAs that were strongly influenced by wind stress-driven oceanic processes. Composite analyses for the eight events showed that more than one-third of the preconvection warming in the initiation region resulted from oceanic processes, including advection and entrainment. Case studies of two strong MISO events associated with ocean-dynamically induced SSTAs showed unmistakable evidence for the preconvection SSTAs and sea surface height anomalies (SSHAs) associated with eastern boundary-reflected (in June/July 2004) and directly forced (in June 2006) intraseasonal oceanic Rossby waves. In those two case studies, a mixed-layer heat budget analysis of the OGCM results showed that advection played a much larger role than entrainment in elevating SSTAs. Further analysis showed that intraseasonal currents associated with the Rossby waves advected high seasonal mean SSTs into the initiation region. As current forecasting skills for the onset of the MISO are low, these results underscore the importance of thoroughly understanding the ocean\\'s role in affecting SSTAs, which contribute to MISO initiation.\\nC1 [West, B.

We hypothesized that stratification from meltwater could reduce light limitation for phytoplankton, and used a suite of numerical models to quantify the impact for 2003-2012. Because much of the 2012 meltwater discharged from southern Greenland, our study focused on the southwestern and southeastern coasts of Greenland, and the Labrador Sea. A 1-D phytoplankton model used output from a Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) coupled with a Regional Climate Model and a hydrological model of meltwater from runoff sources on the ice sheet, peripheral glaciers, and tundra. ROMS was run with and without meltwater to test the sensitivity of phytoplankton photosynthetic rates to the meltwater input. With meltwater, the pycnocline was shallower during late summer and early fall and thus light limitation on photosynthesis was reduced. Averaged over all years, added meltwater had the potential to increase gross primary production by 3-12% in the summer (July-August), and 13-60% in the fall (September-October). This meltwater effect was amplified when light was more limiting, and thus was greatest in the fall, under cloudier conditions, with higher self-shading, and with more light-sensitive phytoplankton groups. As the GrIS melt is projected to increase, late summer primary production in this region has the potential to increase as well, which could constitute an important biosphere response to high-latitude climate change.\\nC1 [Oliver, Hilde; Luo, Hao; Castelao, Renato M.; Mattingly, Kyle S.; Rosen, Joshua J.; Mote, Thomas L.; Yager, Patricia L.] Univ Georgia, Dept Marine Sci, Athens, GA 30602 USA.\\n   [van Dijken, Gert L.; Arrigo, Kevin R.] Stanford Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.\\n   [Rennermalm, Asa K.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Geog, Piscataway, NJ USA.\\n   [Tedesco, Marco] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, New York, NY USA.\\nRP Oliver, H (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Dept Marine Sci, Athens, GA 30602 USA.\\nEM hildeoliver@uga.edu\\nRI Yager, Patricia L/K-8020-2014; Mote, Thomas/U-6681-2017\\nOI Yager, Patricia L/0000-0002-8462-6427; Rennermalm,\\n   Asa/0000-0002-2470-7444; Mattingly, Kyle/0000-0002-7384-0903; Arrigo,\\n   Kevin/0000-0002-7364-876X; Tedesco, Marco/0000-0002-7549-9307; Van\\n   Dijken, Gert/0000-0002-9587-6317; Luo, Hao/0000-0001-5199-7072; Oliver,\\n   Hilde/0000-0002-5507-3333; Mote, Thomas/0000-0002-0021-0134\\nFU NASA [NNX14AD98G]; University of Georgia Presidential Scholarship; NSF\\n   Graduate Research Fellowship (GRFP); NASA\\'s Physical Oceanography\\n   program, Ocean Surface Topography Science Team [NNX13AD80G]; NASA\\'s\\n   Physical Oceanography program, Ocean Vector Winds Science Team\\n   [NNX14AM70G]\\nFX We acknowledge the thoughtful comments and suggestions from two\\n   anonymous reviewers, which resulted in a much-improved manuscript.

There are two turbulent flow regimes: wind speed range of 2.5 to 30 m/s where the drag coefficients increase with wind speed, and wind speed range of 30 to 50 m/s where sheltering/drag coefficients decrease/saturate with wind speed. By comparing model calculations of drag coefficients - using a fixed sheltering coefficient - with ocean observations over a wind speed range of 1 to 50 m/s a similar Reynolds number dependence of the oceanic sheltering coefficient is revealed. In consequence the drag coefficient is a function of Reynolds number and wave age, and not just wind speed as frequently assumed. The resulting decreasing drag coefficient above 30 m/s is shown to be critical in explaining the rapid intensification so prominent in the climatology of Atlantic hurricanes. The Reynolds number dependence of the sheltering coefficient, when employed in coupled models, should lead to significant improvements in the prediction of intensification and decay of tropical cyclones. A calculation of curvature at the wave crest suggests that at wind speeds above 56.15 m/s all waves--breaking or not--induce steady flow separation leading to a minimum in the drag coefficient. This is further evidence of the veracity of the observations of the oceanic drag coefficient at high winds.\\nC1 [Donelan, Mark A.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USA.\\nRP Donelan, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USA.\\nEM mdonelan@rsmas.miami.edu\\nNR 40\\nTC 36\\nZ9 37\\nU1 0\\nU2 14\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

A group of apparent hadal endemics is within the snailfishes (Liparidae), found in at least five geographically separated trenches. Little is known about their biology, let alone the reasons for their success at hadal depths around the world. This study investigated the life history of hadal liparids using sagittal otoliths of two species from the Kermadec (Notoliparis kermadecensis) and Mariana (Pseudoliparis swirei) trenches in comparison to successful abyssal macrourids found at the abyssal-hadal transition zone. Otoliths for each species revealed alternating opaque and translucent growth zones that could be quantified in medial sections. Assuming these annuli represent annual growth, ages were estimated for the two hadal liparid species to be from five to 16 years old. These estimates were compared to the shallower-living snailfish Careproctus melanurus, which were older than described in previous studies, expanding the potential maximum age for the liparid family to near 25 years. Age estimates for abyssal macrourids ranged from eight to 29 years for Coryphaenoides armatus and six to 16 years for C. yaquinae. In addition, O-18/O-16 ratios (delta O-18) were measured across the otolith using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) to investigate the thermal history of the three liparids, and two macrourids. Changes in delta O-18 values were observed across the otoliths of C. melanurus, C. armatus, and both hadal liparids, the latter of which may represent a change of > 5 degrees C in habitat temperature through ontogeny. The results would indicate there is a pelagic larval stage for the hadal liparids that rises to a depth above 1000 m, followed by a return to the hadal environment as these liparids grow. This result was unexpected for the hadal liparids given their isolated environment and large eggs, and the biological implications and plausibility of interpretations of these data are discussed. This study presents a first look at the life history of some of the deepest-living fishes through otolith analyses.\\nC1 [Gerringer, M. E.; Drazen, J.

This data set reveals the full Southern Ocean SSH seasonal cycle for the first time; there is an antiphase relationship between sea level on the Antarctic continental shelf and the deeper basins, with coastal SSH highest in autumn and lowest in spring. As a result of this pattern of seasonal SSH variability, the barotropic component of the Antarctic Slope Current (ASC) has speeds that are regionally up to twice as fast in the autumn. Month-to-month circulation variability of the Ross and Weddell Gyres is strongly influenced by the local wind field, and is correlated with the local wind curl (Ross: -0.58; Weddell: -0.67). SSH variability is linked to both the Southern Oscillation and the Southern Annular Mode, dominant modes of southern hemisphere climate variability. In particular, during the strong 2015-2016 El Nino, a sustained negative coastal SLA of up to -6 cm, implying a weakening of the ASC, was observed in the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean. The ability to examine sea level variability in the seasonally ice-covered regions of the Southern Oceanclimatically important regions with an acute sparsity of datamakes this new merged sea level record of particular interest to the Southern Ocean oceanography and glaciology communities.\\nC1 [Armitage, Thomas W.

Here we analyze a subset of the CMIP5 global Earth system model ensemble using a statistical downscaling approach to determine potential future changes in benthic temperatures on the northwest Atlantic continental shelf and slope (<500 m). We put future changes in the context of possible impacts of ocean warming on the high-value, wild-caught American Lobster (Homarus americanus) fishery. Future bottom temperatures of the northwest Atlantic under a business-as-usual (RCP8.5) and a climate-policy (RCP4.5) scenario are projected to increase by 0-1.5 degrees C and 1.2-2.4 degrees C by 2050 and 0-1.9 degrees C and 2.3-4.3 degrees C by the end of the century for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. H. americanus experiences thermal stress at temperatures above 20 degrees C, and projected increases in temperature is likely to result in changes in the distribution of optimal thermal egg hatching and settlement indicators. Inshore regions of southern New England, where H. americanus biomass and catch have been declining historically, will likely become inhospitable under either future scenario, while thermal egg hatching and settlement indicators will expand offshore and in the Gulf of Maine. These changes imply that members of the fishery based in southern New England may need to recapitalize to larger vessels to prepare for potential changes brought on by future climate warming. Results from the downscaling presented here can be useful in preparing for potential changes to other fisheries or in future climate vulnerability analyses.\\nC1 [Rheuban, Jennie E.; Kavanaugh, Maria T.; Doney, Scott C.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Marine Chem & Geochem Dept, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\n   [Kavanaugh, Maria T.] Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.\\n   [Doney, Scott C.] Univ Virginia, Dept Environm Sci, Clark Hall, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA.\\nRP Rheuban, JE (通讯作者)，Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Marine Chem & Geochem Dept, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\nEM jrheuban@whoi.edu\\nRI Doney, Scott C/F-9247-2010\\nOI Doney, Scott C/0000-0002-3683-2437; Kavanaugh, Maria/0000-0001-6126-6177\\nFU John D. and Catherine T.

In this paper, those phytoplankton blooms were simulated by a coupled physical-biological model, driven by observed meteorological forcing in 1998. The model reasonably reproduced the lake currents. The biological model results, with and without riverine nutrient loading, were compared with the remote sensing data. A 3-month-long donut-like phytoplankton bloom that appeared in southern Lake Michigan was reasonably well simulated only when riverine input was included, indicating the importance of riverine nutrient input for supporting the growth of phytoplankton in Lake Michigan. The model with riverine input also captured a second event-driven phytoplankton bloom during June with weaker magnitude that occurred in mid-south Lake Michigan, which lasted for about 20 days. The major reason for the weaker bloom in June was that vertical mixing in the hydrodynamic model was too weak (leading to a mixed-layer depth of 20 m) to bring the bottom nutrient-rich water up to the epilimnion. High chlorophyll concentration that persisted in Green Bay for almost a year was simulated with less intensity.\\nC1 [Luo, Lin; Wang, Dongxiao] Chinese Acad Sci, South China Sea Inst Oceanol, State Key Lab Trop Oceanog, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.\\n   [Wang, Jia; Hunter, Timothy; Vanderploeg, Henry A.] NOAA, Great Lakes Environm Res Lab, 2205 Commonwealth Blvd, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USA.\\nRP Wang, J (通讯作者)，NOAA, Great Lakes Environm Res Lab, 2205 Commonwealth Blvd, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USA.\\nEM jia.wang@noaa.gov\\nRI WANG, DongXiao/B-4445-2012\\nOI WANG, DongXiao/0000-0001-8778-2188\\nFU EPA Great Lakes Restoration Initiative; National Natural Science\\n   Foundation of Guangdong, China [2014A030313777]; Overseas Partnership\\n   Innovative Project of SCSIO\\nFX We appreciate the support from EPA Great Lakes Restoration Initiative to\\n   the climate change project awarded to Drs.

Coastal waters, which frequently have surface chlorophyll values in the mesosphere range and have strong horizontal chlorophyll gradients and large temporal variations. Thus programs of detailed coastal nutrient surveys are essential to the study of the dynamics of oceanic net primary productivity, along with land use impacts on estuarine and coastal ecosystems. The degree of variability in these regions necessitates flexible instrumentation capable of near real-time analysis to detect and monitor analytes of interest. This work describes the development of a portable coastal surface seawater analyzer for nutrient mapping that can simultaneously elucidate with high resolution the distribution of nitrate, nitrite, and ammonium - the three principal nitrogenous inorganic nutrients in coastal systems. The approach focuses on the use of pulsed xenon flash lamps to construct an analyzer which can be adapted to any automated chemistry with fluorescence detection. The system has two heaters, on-the-fly standardization, on-board data logging, an independent 24 volt direct current power supply, internal local operating network, a 12 channel peristaltic pump, four rotary injection/selection valves, and an intuitive graphical user interface. Using the methodology of Masserini and Fanning (2000) the detection limits for ammonium, nitrite, and nitrate plus nitrite were 11, 10, and 22 nM, respectively. A field test of the analyzer in Gulf of Mexico coastal waters demonstrated its ability to monitor and delineate the complexity of inorganic nitrogen nutrient enrichments within a coastal system.\\nC1 [Masserini, Robert T., Jr.; Hendrix, Steven A.; Kleiman, Brittany M.] Univ Tctrapa, Dept Chem Biochem & Phys, 401 West Kennedy Blvd, Tampa, FL 33606 USA.\\n   [Fanning, Kent A.] Univ S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, 140 7th Ave S, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA.\\nRP Masserini, RT (通讯作者)，Univ Tctrapa, Dept Chem Biochem & Phys, 401 West Kennedy Blvd, Tampa, FL 33606 USA.\\nEM rmasserini@ut.edu; kaf@usf.edu; shendrix@ut.edu;\\n   brittany.kleiman@spartans.ut.edu\\nFU US Office of Naval Research (ONR) [N00014-96-1-5024, N00014-02-1-0240,\\n   N00014-07-1-0800]\\nFX This research was supported by the US Office of Naval Research (ONR\\n   Contracts N00014-96-1-5024, N00014-02-1-0240, and N00014-07-1-0800 to\\n   Kent A.

Aegean) Sea and form a strong front due to occurring upwelling waters during the summer months. The upwelling processes over the Lesvos coastal region are investigated with the use of in situ measurements, numerical simulations, and satellite observations. The interaction of the major lateral buoyant input of Black Sea Waters (BSW) with the upwelling processes and waters is also investigated. The offshore propagation of the up-welled waters over the central N. Aegean region and their interactions with the permanent central cyclonic eddies, the major BSW patterns and the general Aegean cyclonic circulation determine their fate over the Aegean Sea. The upwelling depth is small over the Lesvos coastal region and is restricted in the subsurface ocean (<40 m). The shallow upwelling depth is also confirmed by the reduction of the Apparent Oxygen Utilization (AOU) levels during upwelling events while the pre-existing surface waters, affected by the BSW plume reveal higher AOUvalues. More importantly, the up welled waters come from above the thermocline nutrient depleted layer and, therefore, no major blooming events may be triggered in the central and eastern Aegean during the summer months. Southerly winds on the other hand, have a double effect. They form upwelling unfavorable conditions and they may facilitate the BSW propagation towards the upwelling region, blocking the eastward Ekman current and strengthening the stratification due to the formation of a surface barrier layer.\\nC1 [Androulidakis, Yannis S.] Univ Miami, RSMAS MPO, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, 4600 Rickenbacker Cswy, Miami, FL 33149 USA.\\n   [Androulidakis, Yannis S.; Krestenitis, Yannis N.] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Lab Maritime Engn & Maritime Works, Thessaloniki, Greece.\\n   [Psarra, Stella] Hellen Ctr Marine Res, Inst Marine Biol Crete, Iraklion, Crete, Greece.\\nRP Androulidakis, YS (通讯作者)，Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Lab Maritime Engn & Maritime Works, Thessaloniki, Greece.\\nEM iandroul@civil.auth.gr; ynkrest@civil.auth.gr; spsarra@hcmr.gr\\nRI Androulidakis, Yannis/AAL-4392-2021; Krestenitis, Yannis/AAN-7438-2020\\nOI Androulidakis, Yannis/0000-0002-7005-3963; Krestenitis,\\n   Yannis/0000-0002-9456-5269\\nFU AegeanMarTech project: The AegeanMaffech project through the Operational\\n   Program \"Education and Lifelong Learning, more specifically through the\\n   Research Funding Program: \"THALES\" [MIS:383548, CCI:2007GRO5UPO002];\\n   European Union (European Social Fund); Greek National Funds\\nFX This research was conducted in the framework of the AegeanMarTech\\n   project: The AegeanMaffech project - \"Technological and oceanographic\\n   cooperation Network for the Study of mechanisms fertilizing the\\n   North-East Aegean Sea\" (Project code nr/MIS:383548) was implemented\\n   through the Operational Program \"Education and Lifelong Learning\\n   2007-2013\" (CCI:2007GRO5UPO002) of the National Strategic Reference\\n   Framework (NSRF), more specifically through the Research Funding\\n   Program: \"THALES\" and has been co-financed by the European Union\\n   (European Social Fund) and Greek National Funds.

According to the OHC changes, the subsurface and deeper ocean (SDO, 300-2000 m) heat content rapidly increased over the world\\'s ocean basins during 1998-2013, indicating significant warming in the SDO during the recent global surface warming hiatus. Almost all the ocean basins warmed up, but with various contributions to the global SDO warming tied to the recent hiatus. The role of the Indian Ocean is particularly important as it has accounted for about 30% of global SDO heat uptake during the hiatus. The combined use of multiple data sets can reveal inconsistencies in SDO warming analysis results, and improve our understanding of the role of the SDO in the recent hiatus. The heat uptake in global SDO during the hiatus was about 2.37, 5.44, 3.75, and 2.44 x 10(22) joules with trends of 0.40, 0.70, 0.77, and 0.48 W m(-2) according to WOA, MyOcean, ORAS4, and SODA respectively, presenting obviously inconsistent SDO warming signals. MyOcean shows OHC overestimates in different ocean basins, while ORAS4 presents more reliable SDO OHC analysis. In general, the global SDO has sequestered a significant amount of heatabout 3.50 x 10(22) joules with trends of 0.59 W m(-2) on average among the four data setsduring the recent hiatus, demonstrating widespread and significant warming signals in the global SDO. There remain substantial uncertainties and discrepancies, however (especially in the PO and SO), in the available SDO warming information due to insufficient subsurface observation coverage and variations in the data set generation techniques used among different researchers.\\nC1 [Su, Hua] Fuzhou Univ, Minist Educ, Natl Engn Res Ctr Geospatial Informat Technol, Key Lab Spatial Data Min & Informat Sharing, Fuzhou, Fujian, Peoples R China.\\n   [Su, Hua; Yan, Xiao-Hai] Univ Delaware Xiamen Univ Joint Inst Coastal Res, Newark, DE 19716 USA.\\n   [Su, Hua; Yan, Xiao-Hai] Univ Delaware Xiamen Univ Joint Inst Coastal Res, Xiamen, Peoples R China.\\n   [Wu, Xiangbai] Hohai Univ, Coll Oceanog, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.\\n   [Lu, Wenfang; Zhang, Weiwei] Xiamen Univ, State Key Lab Marine Environm Sci, Xiamen, Peoples R China.\\n   [Lu, Wenfang; Zhang, Weiwei] Univ Delaware, Ctr Remote Sensing, Coll Earth Ocean & Environm, Newark, DE USA.\\nRP Yan, XH (通讯作者)，Univ Delaware Xiamen Univ Joint Inst Coastal Res, Newark, DE 19716 USA.; Yan, XH (通讯作者)，Univ Delaware Xiamen Univ Joint Inst Coastal Res, Xiamen, Peoples R China.\\nEM xiaohai@udel.edu\\nRI Lu, Wenfang/M-3633-2019\\nOI Lu, Wenfang/0000-0003-1303-9820; Wu, Xiangbai/0000-0002-0392-6816\\nFU National Natural Science Foundation of China [41601444, 41630963,\\n   41476007]; SOA Global Change and Air-Sea Interaction Project\\n   [GASI-IPOVAI-01-04]; Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province,\\n   China [2017J01657]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2016M600495,\\n   2017T100466]; Fujian Collaborative Innovation Center for Big Data\\n   Applications in Governments [2015750401]\\nFX National Natural Science Foundation of China (41601444), SOA Global\\n   Change and Air-Sea Interaction Project (GASI-IPOVAI-01-04), Natural\\n   Science Foundation of Fujian Province, China (2017J01657), China\\n   Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2016M600495, 2017T100466), National\\n   Natural Science Foundation of China (41630963, 41476007), and Fujian\\n   Collaborative Innovation Center for Big Data Applications in Governments\\n   (2015750401) are acknowledged for financial supports.

In turbid waters where optical properties may be influenced by terrigenous discharge and nonphytoplankton water constituents, remote estimation of PSC is still a challenging task. Here based on measurements of phytoplankton diagnostic pigments, total chlorophyll a, and spectral reflectance in turbid waters of Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea during summer 2015, a customized model is developed and validated to estimate PSC in the two semienclosed seas. Five diagnostic pigments determined through high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) measurements are first used to produce weighting factors to model phytoplankton biomass (using total chlorophyll a as a surrogate) with relatively high accuracies. Then, a common method used to calculate contributions of microphytoplankton, nanophytoplankton, and picophytoplankton to the phytoplankton assemblage (i.e., F-m, F-n, and F-p) is customized using local HPLC and other data. Exponential functions are tuned to model the size-specific chlorophyll a concentrations (C-m, C-n, and C-p for microphytoplankton, nanophytoplankton, and picophytoplankton, respectively) with remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs) and total chlorophyll a as the model inputs. Such a PSC model shows two improvements over previous models: (1) a practical strategy (i.e., model C-p and C-n first, and then derive C-m as C-C-p-C-n) with an optimized spectral band (680 nm) for R-rs as the model input; (2) local parameterization, including a local chlorophyll a algorithm. The performance of the PSC model is validated using in situ data that were not used in the model development. Application of the PSC model to GOCI (Geostationary Ocean Color Imager) data leads to spatial and temporal distribution patterns of phytoplankton size classes (PSCs) that are consistent with results reported from field measurements by other researchers. While the applicability of the PSC model together with its parameterization to other optically complex regions and to other seasons is unknown, the findings of this study suggest that the approach to develop such a model may be extendable to other cases as long as local data are used to select the optimal band and to determine the model coefficients.\\nC1 [Sun, Deyong; Huan, Yu; Qiu, Zhongfeng; Wang, Shengqiang; He, Yijun] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Marine Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.\\n   [Sun, Deyong; Qiu, Zhongfeng; Wang, Shengqiang; He, Yijun] NUIST, Jiangsu Res Ctr Ocean Survey Technol, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.\\n   [Hu, Chuanmin] Univ S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, St Petersburg, FL USA.\\nRP Sun, DY; Qiu, ZF (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Marine Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Sun, DY; Qiu, ZF (通讯作者)，NUIST, Jiangsu Res Ctr Ocean Survey Technol, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.\\nEM sundeyong1984@163.com; zhongfeng.qiu@nuist.edu.cn\\nRI Hu, Chuanmin/AAB-9604-2021\\nOI Hu, Chuanmin/0000-0003-3949-6560; Huan, Yu/0000-0003-2703-4430; He,\\n   Yijun/0000-0002-1531-5262\\nFU National Natural Science Foundation of China [41576172, 41506200];\\n   National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC1400904,\\n   2016YFC1400901]; Provincial Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu in\\n   China [BK20151526, BK20150914]; Natural Science Foundation of the\\n   Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China [15KJB170015]; National\\n   Program on Global Change and Air-sea Interaction [GASI-03-03-01-01];\\n   Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education\\n   Institutions (PAPD); Qing Lan Project\\nFX This research was jointly supported by the National Natural Science\\n   Foundation of China (41576172 and 41506200), the National Key Research\\n   and Development Program of China (2016YFC1400904 and 2016YFC1400901),\\n   the Provincial Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu in China\\n   (BK20151526 and BK20150914), the Natural Science Foundation of the\\n   Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China (15KJB170015), the\\n   National Program on Global Change and Air-sea Interaction\\n   (GASI-03-03-01-01), a project funded by \"the Priority Academic Program\\n   Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD),\\'\\' and also\\n   sponsored by Qing Lan Project.

The life cycle of O. bartramii is highly susceptible to climatic and oceanic factors. In this study, we have examined the impacts of climate variability and local biophysical environments on the interannual variability of the abundance of the western winter-spring cohort of O. bartramii over the period of 1995-2011. The results showed that the squid had experienced alternant positive and negative Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) over the past 17 years during which five El Nino and eight La Nina events occurred. The catch per unit effort (CPUE) was positively correlated with the PDO index (PDOI) at a one-year time lag. An abnormally warm temperature during the La Nina years over the positive PDO phase provided favorable oceanographic conditions for the habitats of O. bartramii, whereas a lower temperature on the fishing ground during the El Nino years over the negative PDO phase generally corresponded to a low CPUE. The same correlation was also found between CPUE and Chl a concentration anomaly. A possible explanation was proposed that the CPUE was likely related to the climate-induced variability of the large-scale circulation in the Northwest Pacific Ocean: high squid abundance often occurred in a year with a significant northward meander of the Kuroshio Current. The Kuroshio Current advected the warmer and food-rich waters into the fishing ground, and multiple meso-scale eddies arising from current instability enhanced the food retention on the fishing ground, all of which were favorable for the life stage development of the western squid stocks. Our results help better understand the potential process that the climatic and oceanographic factors affect the abundance of the winter-spring cohort of O. bartramii in the Northwest Pacific Ocean.\\nC1 [Yu Wei; Chen Xinjun; Zhang Yu] Shanghai Ocean Univ, Coll Marine Sci, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China.\\n   [Yu Wei; Chen Xinjun] Shanghai Ocean Univ, Natl Engn Res Ctr Ocean Fisheries, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China.\\n   [Yu Wei; Chen Xinjun] Shanghai Ocean Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Sustainable Exploitat Ocean Fisheries Res, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China.\\n   [Yu Wei; Chen Xinjun] Collaborat Innovat Ctr Distant Water Fisheries, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China.\\n   [Chen Changsheng] Univ Massachusetts Dartmouth, Sch Marine Sci & Technol, New Bedford, MA 02744 USA.\\nRP Chen, XJ (通讯作者)，Shanghai Ocean Univ, Coll Marine Sci, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China.; Chen, XJ (通讯作者)，Shanghai Ocean Univ, Natl Engn Res Ctr Ocean Fisheries, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China.; Chen, XJ (通讯作者)，Shanghai Ocean Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Sustainable Exploitat Ocean Fisheries Res, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China.; Chen, XJ (通讯作者)，Collaborat Innovat Ctr Distant Water Fisheries, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China.\\nEM xjchen@shou.edu.cn\\nRI Zhang, Yu/AAE-6967-2020\\nOI Zhang, Yu/0000-0001-8099-9114\\nFU China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2017M611612]; National Key\\n   Technologies R&D Program of China [2013BAD13B01]; Doctoral Startup\\n   Scientific Research Foundation of Shanghai Ocean University\\n   [A2-0203-17-100313]; Open Fund for Key Laboratory of Sustainable\\n   Exploitation of Oceanic Fisheries Resources in Shanghai Ocean University\\n   [A1-0203-00-2009-5]; Shanghai Universities First-Class Disciplines\\n   Project (Fisheries A)\\nFX Foundation item: The China Postdoctoral Science Foundation under\\n   contract No. 2017M611612; the National Key Technologies R&D Program of\\n   China under contract No. 2013BAD13B01; the Doctoral Startup Scientific\\n   Research Foundation of Shanghai Ocean University under contract No.\\n   A2-0203-17-100313; the Open Fund for Key Laboratory of Sustainable\\n   Exploitation of Oceanic Fisheries Resources in Shanghai Ocean University\\n   under contract No. A1-0203-00-2009-5; the Shanghai Universities\\n   First-Class Disciplines Project (Fisheries A); the Global-FVCOM system\\n   was developed with an infrastructure support by the Sino-US Joint\\n   Innovative Center for Polar Ocean Research (SU-JICPOR), International\\n   Center for Marine Studies, Shanghai Ocean University.\\nNR 58\\nTC 6\\nZ9 10\\nU1 3\\nU2 17\\nPU SPRINGER\\nPI NEW YORK\\nPA 233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA\\nSN 0253-505X\\nEI 1869-1099\\nJ9 ACTA OCEANOL SIN\\nJI Acta Oceanol.

A distinctive feature is the occurrence of surface patches that are relatively clear of algae and which grow in size. These patches are interpreted as resulting from the horizontally diverging motion associated with boils. The surface divergence in such boils can be as large as similar to 0.01 s(-1), as deduced directly from the imagery. Overall, root-mean-squared values of divergence, vorticity, and strain rate are 45, 58, and 170, respectively, when normalized by the Coriolis parameter. By observing the algae and its fluid environment simultaneously, the analysis thus provides a glimpse of how underlying hydrodynamic processes help shape the distribution of surface algae-under the calm winds that favor the formation of dense surface aggregations.\\nC1 [Marmorino, George O.; Smith, Geoffrey B.; Miller, W.

The mean transports of the two currents are comparable, in line with previous notions that there is a local overturning cell in the Iceland Sea that transforms the Atlantic water to dense overflow water. As the NIJ and NIIC flow along the north side of Iceland, they appear to share a common front when the bottom topography steers them close together, but even when they are separate there is a poleward flow inshore of the NIJ. The interannual variability in salinity of the inflowing NIIC is in phase with that of the outflowing NIJ. It is suggested, however, that the NIIC signal does not dictate that of the NIJ. Instead, the combination of liquid and solid freshwater flux from the east Greenland boundary can account for the observed net freshening of the NIIC to the NIJ for the densest half of the overturning circulation in the northwest Iceland Sea. This implies that the remaining overturning must occur in a different geographic area, consistent with earlier model results. The year-to-year variability in salinity of the NIJ can be explained by applying annual anomalies of evaporation minus precipitation over the Iceland Sea to a one-dimensional mixing model. These anomalies vary in phase with the wind stress curl over the North Atlantic subpolar gyre, which previous studies have shown drives the interannual variation in salinity of the inflowing NIIC.\\nC1 [Pickart, Robert S.; Spall, Michael A.; Torres, Daniel J.; Nobre, C.; Mastropole, Dana] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\n   [Vage, Kjetil] Univ Bergen, Geophys Inst, N-5007 Bergen, Norway.\\n   [Vage, Kjetil] Univ Bergen, Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, N-5007 Bergen, Norway.\\n   [Valdimarsson, Hedinn; Jonsson, Steingrimur] Marine & Freshwater Inst Reykjavik, Iceland Skulagata 4, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland.\\n   [Moore, G.

Consequently, differentiating oil slicks from the seawater in these areas using optical sensors is a challenge. Polarized optical remote sensing techniques provide complementary information for intensity imagery with different physical properties and, thus, possess the ability to resolve this difficult problem. In the polarized reflectance model, the degree of linear polarization (DOLP) of sunglint depends on accurately knowing the Stokes parameter for the reflected light, and varies with the refractive index of the surface layer and viewing angles. For the polarized detection of oil slicks, the highest sensitivity of the DOLP to the refractive index is located within the specular reflection direction where the sum of the solar and sensor zenith angles is 82.6 degrees. The modeled results clearly indicate that the DOLP of oil slicks is weaker in comparison with oil-free seawater under sunglint. Using measurements from the space-borne Polarization and Anisotropy of Reflectances for Atmospheric Sciences coupled with Observations from a Lidar (PARASOL) over the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, we illustrate that the PARASOL-derived DOLP difference between the oil spill and seawater is obvious and is in accordance with the modeled results. These preliminary results suggest that the potential of multiangle measurement and feasibility of deriving refractive index of ocean surface from space-borne sensors need further researches.\\nC1 [Lu, Yingcheng; Zhou, Yang; Liu, Yongxue] Nanjing Univ, Int Inst Earth Syst Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.\\n   [Lu, Yingcheng; Mao, Zhihua] State Ocean Adm, State Key Lab Satellite Ocean Environm Dynam, Inst Oceanog 2, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.\\n   [Lu, Yingcheng; Liu, Yongxue; Wang, Mengqiu; Zhang, Minwei; Sun, Shaojie] Univ S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA.\\n   [Liu, Yongxue; Du, Peijun] Nanjing Univ, Dept Geog Informat Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.\\n   [Qian, Weixian; Xu, Jiang] Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Elect & Opt Engn, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.\\nRP Liu, YX (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ, Int Inst Earth Syst Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Mao, ZH (通讯作者)，State Ocean Adm, State Key Lab Satellite Ocean Environm Dynam, Inst Oceanog 2, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.; Liu, YX (通讯作者)，Univ S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA.; Liu, YX (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ, Dept Geog Informat Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.\\nEM yongxue@nju.edu.cn; mao@sio.org.cn\\nRI liu, yong/AAD-1467-2019\\nOI Zhang, Minwei/0000-0002-9919-4225; Liu, Yongxue/0000-0002-6837-5015;\\n   Wang, Mengqiu/0000-0002-0465-1324; Mao, Zhihua/0000-0002-0066-1808; Sun,\\n   Shaojie/0000-0002-4802-295X; Zhou, Yang/0000-0001-6972-4822\\nFU National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFB0501502,\\n   2016YFC1400901]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41371014,\\n   61675099]\\nFX This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development\\n   Program of China (grant 2016YFB0501502, 2016YFC1400901); the National\\n   Natural Science Foundation of China (grant 41371014, 61675099).

From 1998 to 2013, 46 typhoon events are analyzed to examine the variations in Chl-a concentration from satellite ocean color data. On average, Chl-a concentration increased by 38% after a typhoon passage. Noticeably, four remarkable Chl-a increases after typhoons coincide with pre-existing oceanic cyclones in the study area. The Chl-a increase is significantly anticorrelated (p<0.01) with relative SSH, defined as the difference of SSH in the study area and in the surrounding area. To assess the impact of pre-existing cyclones on the upper ocean response to typhoons, we conduct a series of numerical experiments to simulate the oceanic response to Typhoon Kaemi (2006) with or without a pre-existing oceanic cyclone, and with or without strong typhoon winds. The results show that the experiment with a pre-existing oceanic cyclone produces the largest upwelling due to cyclone intensification, mainly induced by the positive wind stress curl dipole northeast of Taiwan.\\nC1 [Xu, Fanghua; Yao, Yuan; Lin, Yanluan] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Key Lab Earth Syst Modeling, Minist Educ, Beijing, Peoples R China.\\n   [Oey, Leo] Princeton Univ, Program Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.\\n   [Oey, Leo] Natl Cent Univ, Zhongli, Taiwan.\\nRP Xu, FH (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Key Lab Earth Syst Modeling, Minist Educ, Beijing, Peoples R China.\\nEM fxu@tsinghua.edu.cn\\nRI lin, yanluan/A-6333-2015; Xu, Fanghua/H-2398-2015\\nOI lin, yanluan/0000-0002-0865-0580; Xu, Fanghua/0000-0003-4057-8387\\nFU National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) [2013CB956603];\\n   National Natural Science Foundation of China [41576018, 41606020]\\nFX We thank Collecte Localis Satellites, AVISO\\n   (http://www.aviso.oceanobs.com) for the sea surface height observations,\\n   NASA\\'s Ocean Color Working Group for providing MODIS-A/T and SeaWiFS\\n   chlorophyll-a data (http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/), NOAA for AVHRR\\n   ocean surface temperature data (http://gcmd.nasa.gov/), NASA\\'s Earth\\n   Science Enterprise for CCMP wind data (www.remss.com), GODAE for Argo\\n   data (www.argo.ucsd.edu), WMO for typhoon information\\n   (www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ibtracs/), NCEI for WOA13 climatology nutrient data\\n   (www.ncdc.noaa.gov/OC5/woa13/), and National Ocean Partnership Program\\n   for HYCOM reanalysis data (www.hycom.org).

For a reproducible scientific sampling approach, answers should be quantitative and provided using fundamental principles. This article reviews concepts and recent progress toward this principled approach, focusing on reachability, path planning, and adaptive sampling, and presents results of a real-time forecasting and planning experiment completed during February-April 2017 for the Northern Arabian Sea Circulation-autonomous research program. The predictive skill, layered fields, and uncertainty estimates obtained using the MIT MSEAS multi-resolution ensemble ocean modeling system are first studied. With such inputs, deterministic and probabilistic three-dimensional reachability forecasts issued daily for gliders and floats are then showcased and validated. Finally, a Bayesian adaptive sampling framework is shown to forecast in real time the observations that are most informative for estimating classic ocean fields and also secondary variables such as Lagrangian coherent structures.\\nC1 [Lermusiaux, Pierre F.

The simulations use the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model (MITgcm) to calculate for an infinitely deep ocean the dependence of the energy conversion on seamount slope, seamount separation, tidal direction, and the size and aspect ratio of the simulation domain. For neighboring seamounts with a slope greater than the internal wave beam slope, wave interference reduces the conversion relative to that calculated for an isolated seamount, and relative to that predicted by linear theory for a seamount of slope less than the beam slope. The conversion by an individual seamount in a system of random seamounts separated by an average distance of 18 km is found to be suppressed by 16% relative to the conversion by an isolated seamount. This study provides insight into tidal conversion by ocean seamounts modeled as Gaussian mountains with slopes both smaller and larger than the beam slope. We conclude that the total energy conversion by all seamounts (peak height >= 1000 m) and knolls (peak height 500-1000 m), taking into account interference affects, is of the order of 1% of the total barotropic to baroclinic energy conversion in the oceans, which is about twice as large as previous estimates.\\nC1 [Zhang, Likun] Univ Mississippi, Dept Phys & Astron, Oxford, MS 38677 USA.\\n   [Zhang, Likun] Univ Mississippi, Natl Ctr Phys Acoust, Oxford, MS 38677 USA.\\n   [Buijsman, Maarten C.] Univ Southern Mississippi, Stennis Space Ctr, Div Marine Sci, Hancock, MS USA.\\n   [Comino, Eva] Univ Southern Mississippi, Dept Math, Hattiesburg, MS 39406 USA.\\n   [Swinney, Harry L.] Univ Texas Austin, Ctr Nonlinear Dynam, Dept Phys, Austin, TX 78712 USA.\\nRP Zhang, LK (通讯作者)，Univ Mississippi, Dept Phys & Astron, Oxford, MS 38677 USA.; Zhang, LK (通讯作者)，Univ Mississippi, Natl Ctr Phys Acoust, Oxford, MS 38677 USA.\\nEM zhang@olemiss.edu\\nOI Zhang, Likun/0000-0003-3898-6533; Buijsman, Maarten/0000-0001-8478-5957\\nFU Office of Naval Research [N000141110701]; Frederick V.

The MPI version of the Princeton Ocean Model (POM) with hurricane forcing is coupled with the WAVEWATCH-III (WW3) surface wave model. Hurricane Ivan is chosen as the test case due to its extreme intensity and availability of field data during its passage. The model results are validated against field observations of wave heights and sea surface temperatures (SSTs) from the National Data Buoy Centre (NDBC) during Hurricane Ivan and against limited in situ current and bottom temperature data. A series of numerical experiments is set up to examine the influence of the nonbreaking wave parameterization on the mixing of upper ocean. The SST response from the modeling experiments indicates that the nonbreaking wave-induced mixing leads to significant cooling of the SST and deepening of the mixed layer. It was found that the nondimensional constant b(1) in the nonbreaking wave parameterization has different impacts on the weak and the strong sides of the storm track. A constant value of b(1) leads to improved predictions on the strong side of the storm while a steepness-dependent b(1) provides a better agreement with in situ observations on the weak side. A separate simulation of the intense tropical cyclone Olwyn in north-west Australia revealed the same trend for b(1) on the strong side of the tropical cyclone.\\n   Plain Language Summary Operational and forecast models generally underestimate the intensity of tropical cyclones by underestimating the sea surface temperature and the upper ocean mixing. Although the role of ocean waves is now being regarded as essential in ocean mixing, predictive modeling of tropical cyclones does not always include the effects of turbulence generated by waves that would lead to enhanced mixing and therefore increased cooling of sea surface temperatures leading to improved prediction of tropical cyclone intensity. This paper describes the implementation of a new wave model that simulates the turbulence generated by nonbreaking waves in a coupled ocean-wave-hurricane modeling system.\\nC1 [Aijaz, S.] Australian Bur Meteorol, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.\\n   [Ghantous, M.] Univ Toulouse, Lab Etud Geophys & Oceanog Spati, CNES, CNRS,IRD,UPS, Toulouse, France.\\n   [Babanin, A.

The section mean diffusivity can reach 10(-4) m(2)/s, which is an order of magnitude larger than the value in the open ocean. Both internal tides and wind-generated near-inertial internal waves play an important role in furnishing the diapycnal mixing here. The former dominates the diapycnal mixing in the deep ocean and makes nonnegligible contribution in the upper ocean, leading to enhanced diapycnal mixing throughout the water column over rough topography. In contrast, the influence of the wind-induced near-inertial internal wave is mainly confined to the upper ocean. Over both flat and rough bathymetries, the diapycnal diffusivity has a growth trend from 2005 to 2010 in the upper 700 m, which results from the increase of wind work on the near-inertial motions.\\nC1 [Liu Yongzheng; Jing Zhao; Wu Lixin] Ocean Univ China, CIMST, Phys Oceanog Lab, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China.\\n   [Liu Yongzheng; Jing Zhao; Wu Lixin] Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China.\\n   [Jing Zhao] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Oceanog, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.\\nRP Liu, YZ (通讯作者)，Ocean Univ China, CIMST, Phys Oceanog Lab, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China.; Liu, YZ (通讯作者)，Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China.\\nEM lyzh6699@163.com\\nFU National Basic Research Program (973 Program) of China [2013CB956201];\\n   National Natural Science Foundation of China [41521091, U1406401,\\n   41622602]; Global Change Project [GASI-03-01-01-05]\\nFX The National Basic Research Program (973 Program) of China under\\n   contract No. 2013CB956201; the National Natural Science Foundation of\\n   China under contract Nos 41521091, U1406401 and 41622602; the Global\\n   Change Project under contract No. GASI-03-01-01-05.\\nNR 26\\nTC 0\\nZ9 1\\nU1 0\\nU2 12\\nPU SPRINGER\\nPI NEW YORK\\nPA 233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA\\nSN 0253-505X\\nEI 1869-1099\\nJ9 ACTA OCEANOL SIN\\nJI Acta Oceanol.

It is well known that this drag depends on the relative motion between the water and the seagrass blades, yet the impact of blade motion on drag and wave-energy dissipation remains to be fully characterized. In this experimental study, we examined the impact of blade motion on wave decay by concurrently recording blade posture during a wave cycle and measuring wave decay over a model seagrass meadow. We also identified a scaling law that predicts wave decay over the model meadow for a range of seagrass blade density, wave period, wave height, and water depth scaled from typical field conditions. Blade flexibility led to significantly lower drag and wave decay relative to theoretical predictions for rigid, upright blades. To quantify the impact of blade motion on wave decay, we employed an effective blade length, l(e), defined as the rigid blade length that leads to equivalent wave-energy dissipation. We estimated l(e) directly from images of blade motion. Consistent with previous studies, these estimates showed that the effective blade length depends on the dimensionless Cauchy number, which describes the relative magnitude of the wave hydrodynamic drag and the restoring force due to blade rigidity. As the hydrodynamic forcing increases, the blades exhibit greater motion. Greater blade motion leads to smaller relative velocities, reducing drag, and wave-energy dissipation (i.e., smaller l(e)).\\nC1 [Luhar, M.] Univ Southern Calif, Dept Aerosp & Mech Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA.\\n   [Infantes, E.] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Marine Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden.\\n   [Nepf, H.] MIT, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.\\nRP Luhar, M (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Calif, Dept Aerosp & Mech Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA.\\nEM luhar@usc.edu\\nRI Luhar, Mitul/G-9225-2011; Infantes, Eduardo/D-6105-2019\\nOI Luhar, Mitul/0000-0002-7970-9762; Infantes, Eduardo/0000-0002-9724-9237\\nFU US National Science Foundation [OCE 0751358, EAR 1659923]; Formas\\n   [231-2014-735]\\nFX This study received support from the US National Science Foundation\\n   under grants OCE 0751358 and EAR 1659923.

In tsunami models, the vertical seafloor elevation is directly transferred to the sea-surface as the only initial condition. However, evidence from the 2011 Tohoku earthquake indicates otherwise; the vertical seafloor uplift was only 3-5 m, too small to account for the resultant tsunami. Surprisingly, the horizontal displacement was undeniably larger than anyone\\'s expectation; about 60 m at the frontal wedge of the fault plate, the largest slip ever recorded by in situ instruments. The question is whether the horizontal motion of seafloor slopes had enhanced the tsunami to become as destructive as observed. In this study, we provide proof: (1) combining various measurements from the 2011 Tohoku event, we show that the earthquake transferred a total energy of 3.1e+15 joule to the ocean, in which the potential energy (PE) due to the vertical seafloor elevation (including seafloor uplift/subsidence plus the contribution from the horizontal displacement) was less than a half, while the kinetic energy (KE) due to the horizontal displacement velocity of the continental slope contributed a majority portion; (2) using two modern state-of-the-art wave flumes and a three-dimensional tsunami model, we have reproduced the source energy and tsunamis consistent with observations, including the 2004 Sumatra event. Based on the unified source energy formulation, we offer a competing theory to explain why some earthquakes generate destructive tsunamis, while others do not.\\nC1 [Song, Y.

An ensemble sensitivity analysis is used to provide information on the spatial and temporal forcing from mean sea-level pressure and surface wind associated with extreme ocean wave height responses. Extreme ocean waves in the central North Sea arise due to intense extratropical cyclone winds from either the cold conveyor belt (northerly-wind events) or the warm conveyor belt (southerly-wind events). The largest wave heights are associated with northerly-wind events which tend to have stronger wind speeds and occur as the cold conveyor belt wraps rearward round the cyclone to the cold side of the warm front. The northerly-wind events provide a larger fetch to the central North Sea to aid wave growth. Southerly-wind events are associated with the warm conveyor belts of intense extratropical cyclones that develop in the left upper tropospheric jet exit region. Ensemble sensitivity analysis can provide early warning of extreme wave events by demonstrating a relationship between wave height and high pressure to the west of the British Isles for northerly-wind events 48 h prior. Southerly-wind extreme events demonstrate sensitivity to low pressure to the west of the British Isles 36 h prior.\\n   Plain Language Summary This study investigates how large-scale storms, known as extratropical cyclones, are related to extreme wave events in the North Sea. The North Sea houses oil and gas platforms as well as provides passage to cruise ships, thus, extreme wave events can impact the safety of ongoing operations in these industries. For this study, we examined 20 years of data to determine what storms led to extreme wave events and what characteristics those storms, or the environment that they are in, have in common. We found that in the two days prior to a storm which results in an extreme wave event, the strengthening of a high pressure system to the west of the British Isles was key. These new findings can improve warnings of extreme wave events in the North Sea and therefore enhance safety for industry operations.\\nC1 [Bell, R.

The experiments were all carried out in the subcritical regime, leading to cusps style instabilities at the interface of the two fluids. Flocculation in the experiments was not suppressed, yet flocs remained small while in the plume layer. Data from the experiments allowed for calculation of the individual floc settling velocity, W-s,W-f, and the overall effective settling velocity, W-s,W-eff, i.e., that velocity needed to predict the downward flux with C-Ws,C-eff. Results showed that W-s,W-eff was greater than the floc settling velocity in all runs. W-s,W-eff was found to increase with plume velocity and interface mixing but not with plume concentration. The difference between the effective and floc settling velocities was therefore attributed to turbulent diffusion brought on by mixing at the interface and not to convective sedimentation or leaking. The turbulence enhanced settling velocity, W-s,W-t, was found to be a strong function of the Richardson number, and conceptual and empirical equations are presented to predict W-s,W-t as a function of the plume surface velocity, U-ps, and Richardson number, Ri; this analysis showed that W-s,W-t proportional to U(ps)Ri(-2). In the runs with low Richardson number, W-s,W-t was approximately equal to the floc settling velocity, leading to an overall doubling of the effective settling velocity relative to that of the individual particles.\\nC1 [Rouhnia, Mohamad; Strom, Kyle] Virginia Tech, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.\\nRP Rouhnia, M (通讯作者)，Virginia Tech, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.\\nEM mohamadr@vt.edu\\nOI Strom, Kyle/0000-0002-0798-7720\\nFU Petroleum Research Fund [PRF51958-ND8]\\nFX This work was supported by the Petroleum Research Fund (PRF51958-ND8).\\n   We, the authors, would like to thank Duc Tran who helped in running the\\n   experiments and building the experimental flume.

Breaking waves are identified using images collected with cameras onboard the buoys, and the breaking activity is well-correlated with wave steepness. Vertical shear in the currents produces a frequency-dependent effective current that modifies the linear dispersion relation. Accounting for these sheared currents in the wavenumber spectrum is essential in calculating the correct wave steepness; without this, wave steepness can be over (under) estimated on opposing (following) currents by up to 20%. The observed bulk steepness values suggest a limiting value of 0.4. The observed fraction of breaking waves is in good agreement with several existing models, each based on wave steepness. Further, a semispectral model designed for all depth regimes also compares favorably with measured breaking fractions. In this model, the majority of wave breaking is predicted to occur in the higher frequency bands (i.e., short waves). There is a residual dependence on directional spreading, in which wave breaking decreases with increasing directional spread.\\n   Plain Language Summary We measured wave breaking and currents at the Columbia River Mouth, the second largest river in the U.S. Breaking waves here and at other river inlets are a hazard to marine traffic, such as fishing, shipping, and boating. Rivers also bring pollutants and nutrients to the ocean, and breaking waves can influence whether they stay near the coast or travel farther out to sea. Predicting when and where waves break is difficult, especially at river inlets where tides and river currents modify the waves from how we understand them in the open ocean or at beaches. We found that currents below the surface were important in predicting where waves break. Once we accounted for these currents, wave breaking was well predicted by existing theories. These theories had yet to be extensively tested with field data from regions with strong currents, or at water depths shallower than those found in the open ocean but deeper than those found at the beach.\\nC1 [Zippel, Seth; Thomson, Jim] Univ Washington, Appl Phys Lab, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.\\nRP Zippel, S (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Appl Phys Lab, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.\\nEM zippelsf@uw.edu\\nRI Thomson, Jim/C-7610-2012\\nOI Thomson, Jim/0000-0002-8929-0088; Zippel, Seth/0000-0002-6287-9896\\nFU Office of Naval Research as part of the Data Assimilation and Remote\\n   Sensing for Littoral Applications (DARLA) project; Rivers and Inlets\\n   (RIVET) program\\nFX SWIFT data are available at http://www.apl.washington.edu/swift.

These habitats are important in their own right; many species on organic falls are not able to survive in other deep sea ecosystems. Evolutionary transitions of species among various chemosynthesis-based ecosystems does not proceed deliberately from organic falls toward hydrothermal vents. Polyplacophoran molluscs (chitons) are generally rare in deep-sea systems but are found in comparatively high diversity and abundance on tropical sunken wood. A new time calibrated phylogeny for the predominantly deep-sea order Lepidopleurida shows the chiton lineages found in sunken wood habitats do not comprise a single Glade or radiation, but represents a minimum of three independent radiations in the Pacific alone. Most marine invertebrate groups diversified in the deep sea following the end Cretaceous extinction event; by contrast, sunken-wood chitons may have persisted in these habitats for longer than other animals. Fossil chitons from the early Carboniferous (ca. 350 Mya) have strong similarities to modern wood-endemic taxa, yet the common ancestor of living Lepidopleurida occurred much later in the Triassic and did not apparently rely on woodfall. Clades within Lepidopleurida that occupy wood habitats in the tropical Pacific probably arose in the Jurassic, which corresponds to evidence from the fossil record, but with an additional separate colonisation more recently in the early Paleogene. Wood-endemic chiton species encompass multiple independent evolutionary origins of co-occurring wood species, and these separate lineages correspond to differences in micohabitat and feeding strategies. These patterns demonstrate the ongoing evolutionary linkages between terrestrial and deep marine environments, and the opportunistic adaptations of deep-sea organisms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Our observations provide an illustration of this process at the Timor Basin scale of similar to 1000 km. Long-term averaged moored velocity data at the Timor western sill suggest that a deep circulation is present in the Timor Basin. An inflow transport of similar to 0.15 Sv is observed between 1600 m and the bottom at 1890 m. Since the basin is closed on its eastern side below 1250 m depth, a return flow must be generated above 1600 m with a similar to 0.15 Sv outflow. The vertical turbulent diffusivity is inferred from a heat and transport balance at the basin scale and from Thorpe scale analysis. Basin averaged vertical diffusivity is as large as 1 x 10(-3) m(2) s(-1). Observations are compared with regional low-resolution numerical simulations, and the deep observed circulation is only recovered when a strong vertical diffusivity resulting from the parameterization of internal tidal mixing is considered. Furthermore, the deep vertical mixing appears to be strongly dependent on the choice of the internal tide mixing parameterization and also on the prescribed value of the mixing efficiency.\\nC1 [Cuypers, Yannis; Pous, Stephane; Madec, Gurvan; Molcard, Robert] Univ Paris 06, UPMC, Sorbonne Univ, CNRS,IRD,MNHN,LOCEAN Lab, 4 Pl Jussieu, F-75005 Paris, France.\\n   [Pous, Stephane] Univ Cape Town, Dept Oceanog, Cape Town, South Africa.\\n   [Sprintall, Janet] Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA USA.\\n   [Atmadipoera, Agus] Bogor Agr Univ, Dept Marine Sci & Technol, Bogor, Indonesia.\\nRP Cuypers, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 06, UPMC, Sorbonne Univ, CNRS,IRD,MNHN,LOCEAN Lab, 4 Pl Jussieu, F-75005 Paris, France.\\nEM Yannis.Cuypers@locean-ipsl.upmc.fr\\nRI Cuypers, Yannis/Q-4473-2019; Atmadipoera, Agus Saleh/AAO-4698-2020;\\n   Cuypers, Yannis/H-9869-2016; madec, gurvan/E-7825-2010\\nOI Atmadipoera, Agus Saleh/0000-0001-8090-0065; Cuypers,\\n   Yannis/0000-0001-9651-154X; madec, gurvan/0000-0002-6447-4198\\nFU GENCI-IDRIS [2010-011140]\\nFX Model experiments were performed using HPC resources from GENCI-IDRIS\\n   (Grant 2010-011140).\\nNR 90\\nTC 4\\nZ9 4\\nU1 3\\nU2 16\\nPU SPRINGER HEIDELBERG\\nPI HEIDELBERG\\nPA TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY\\nSN 1616-7341\\nEI 1616-7228\\nJ9 OCEAN DYNAM\\nJI Ocean Dyn.\\nPD FEB\\nPY 2017\\nVL 67\\nIS 2\\nBP 191\\nEP 209\\nDI 10.1007/s10236-016-1019-y\\nPG 19\\nWC Oceanography\\nWE Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)\\nSC Oceanography\\nGA EK8EE\\nUT WOS:000394155900002\\nOA Green Submitted\\nDA 2022-06-16\\nER\\n\\nPT J\\nAU Evans, GR\\n   McDonagh, EL\\n   King, BA\\n   Bryden, HL\\n   Bakker, DCE\\n   Brown, PJ\\n   Schuster, U\\n   Speer, KG\\n   van Heuven, SMAC\\nAF Evans, G.

Transports of anthropogenic carbon are calculated across the western (Drake Passage), eastern (30 degrees E) and northern (24 degrees S) boundaries. The freshwater overturning transport of 0.09 Sv is southward, consistent with an overturning circulation that exports freshwater from the North Atlantic, and consistent with a bistable Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC), under conditions of excess freshwater perturbation. At 30 degrees E, net eastward Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) transport, south of the Subtropical Front, is compensated by a 15.9 +/- 2.3 Sv westward flow along the Antarctic boundary. The region as a whole is a substantial sink for atmospheric anthropogenic carbon of 0.5 +/- 0.37 Pg C yr(-1), of which 0.18 +/- 0.12 Pg C yr(-1) accumulates and is stored within the water column. At 24 degrees S, a 20.2 Sv meridional overturning is associated with a 0.11 Pg C yr(-1) Cant overturning. The remainder is transported into the Atlantic Ocean north of 24 degrees S (0.28 +/- 0.16 Pg C yr(-1)) and Indian sector of Southern Ocean (1.12 0.43 Pg C yr(-1)), having been enhanced by inflow through Drake Passage (1.07 0.44 Pg C yr-1). This underlines the importance of the South Atlantic as a crucial element of the anthropogenic carbon sink in the global oceans. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\\nC1 [Evans, G.

General Assembly to end the practice of large-scale pelagic driftnet fishing. During two years leading up to the moratorium, three scientific research and fishery observer programs involving Canada, Japan, Korea, China-Taipei and the United States had collected significant amounts of information about the distribution and abundance of the epipelagic fauna in the subtropical North Pacific Ocean. The pan-regional distributions of the fishes in 1990 and 1991, most of which were taken as bycatch in 9910 fishing operations (357,150 km of driftnet) are described. More species were observed per fishing operation in 1991 than in 1990. Principal coordinate analysis of the incidence of the commonly caught fish species was used to show that, except for an anomaly in the region of the Shatsky Rise (165 degrees E), the composition of the catch changed from the coast of Japan across more than 6000 km to the eastern boundary of the fishery (145 degrees W). The analysis suggested that the fish species composition changed rather little with increasing latitude within the southern part of the domain (25-35 degrees N), before changing more rapidly north of the Kuroshio Extension region to a more subarctic, transition zone fauna.

Although each downscaled projection indicates a warming of 12 degrees C between 2010 and 2040 on the Bering Sea shelf, the interannual and interdecadal details of this trend vary considerably among the three realizations. In each case, the magnitude of presently observed interannual variability of bottom temperatures and ice cover is found in the models to be maintained out to at least 2040, but with a steadily increasing probability of warm years with less ice on the southern shelf. The overall trends indicate warmer temperatures and the retreat of ice in the southeastern Bering Sea, but continued ice cover in the northeastern Bering Sea. Sensitivity analyses suggest both increasing air temperature and northward wind stress as primary drivers of higher water-column temperatures. Based on currently available models, changes in shortwave radiation are not likely to have a significant role in this warming. Warming trends on the outer shelf may lead to decreased production of large crustacean zooplankton at that location, but could increase such production on the inner shelf. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The results show that the zonal phase speed of zonal currents varies depending on season and depth in a very complicated way in relation to surface wind forcing. Surface layer zonal velocity propagates to the west in northern spring but to the east in fall in response to zonally propagating surface zonal winds, while in the pycnocline zonal phase speed is related to wind-forced ocean wave dynamics. In the western half of the analysis domain (78 degrees-83 degrees E), zonal phase speed in the pycnocline is eastward all year, which is attributed to the radiation of Kelvin waves forced in the western basin. In the eastern half of the domain (80 degrees-90 degrees E), zonal phase speed is westward at 50- to 100-m depths in northern fall, but eastward above and below, most likely due to Rossby waves generated at the eastern boundary.\\nC1 [Nagura, Motoki] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan.\\n   [McPhaden, Michael J.] NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, 7600 Sand Point Way Ne, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.\\nRP Nagura, M (通讯作者)，2-15 Natsushima Cho, Yokosuka, Kanagawa 2370061, Japan.\\nEM nagura@jamstec.go.jp\\nRI McPhaden, Michael J/D-9799-2016\\nOI McPhaden, Michael J/0000-0002-8423-5805\\nFU MEXT/JSPS KAKENHI [26800249]; NOAA\\nFX We thank two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments on an\\n   earlier version of this manuscript.

The isolated location of Kavachi and its explosive behavior normally restrict scientific access to the volcano\\'s summit, limiting previous observational efforts to surface imagery and peripheral water-column data. This article presents medium-resolution bathymetry of the main peak along with benthic imagery, biological observations of multiple trophic levels living inside the active crater, petrological and geochemical analysis of samples from the crater rim, measurements of water temperature and gas flux over the summit, and descriptions of the hydrothermal plume structure. A second peak was identified to the southwest of the main summit and displayed evidence of diffuse-flow venting. Microbial samples collected from the summit indicate chemosynthetic populations dominated by sulfur-reducing epsilon-proteobacteria. Populations of gelatinous animals, small fish, and sharks were observed inside the active crater, raising new questions about the ecology of active submarine volcanoes and the extreme environments in which large marine animals can exist.\\nC1 [Phillips, Brennan T.] Harvard Univ, John A Paulson Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.\\n   [Phillips, Brennan T.; DeCiccio, Alex; Flinders, Ashton; Kelley, Katherine A.; Carey, Steven] Univ Rhode Isl, Grad Sch Oceanog, Narragansett, RI 02882 USA.\\n   [Dunbabin, Matthew] Queensland Univ Technol, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.\\n   [Henning, Brad] Natl Geog Remote Imaging Team, Washington, DC USA.\\n   [Howell, Corey] Wilderness Lodge, Gatokae Isl, Solomon Islands.\\n   [Scott, Jarrod J.] Bigelow Lab Ocean Sci, East Boothbay, ME USA.\\n   [Albert, Simon; Grinham, Alistair] Univ Queensland, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.\\n   [Tsadok, Rami] Univ Haifa, Leon H Charney Sch Marine Sci, Haifa, Israel.\\nRP Phillips, BT (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, John A Paulson Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.; Phillips, BT (通讯作者)，Univ Rhode Isl, Grad Sch Oceanog, Narragansett, RI 02882 USA.\\nEM btphillips@g.harvard.edu\\nRI Albert, Simon/I-1104-2012; Kelley, Katherine A/J-3728-2013; Dunbabin,\\n   Matthew/B-7527-2011\\nOI Albert, Simon/0000-0002-5947-7909; Kelley, Katherine\\n   A/0000-0002-7516-2683; Dunbabin, Matthew/0000-0003-0806-7720; Grinham,\\n   Alistair/0000-0001-8313-2276; Flinders, Ashton/0000-0003-2483-4635;\\n   Scott, Jarrod/0000-0001-9863-1318\\nFU National Geographic Society [W324-14, W364-14]; University of Rhode\\n   Island\\'s Graduate School of Oceanography Alumni Association\\nFX The authors wish to thank the Solomon Islands government and the Peava\\n   Village community for permitting and assisting in our research\\n   activities.

This export necessarily raises the isopycnals associated with lighter density classes over the continental slope, resulting in density surfaces that connect the near-freezing waters of the continental shelf to the much warmer circumpolar deep water (CDW) at middepth offshore. In this article, an eddy-resolving process model is used to explore the possibility that AABW export enhances shoreward heat transport by creating a pathway for CDW to access the continental shelf without doing any work against buoyancy forces. In the absence of a net alongshore pressure gradient, the shoreward CDW transport is effected entirely by mesoscale and submesoscale eddy transfer. Eddies are generated partly by instabilities at the pycnocline, sourcing their energy from the alongshore wind stress, but primarily by instabilities at the CDW AABW interface, sourcing their energy from buoyancy loss on the continental shelf. This combination of processes induces a vertical convergence of eddy kinetic energy and alongshore momentum into the middepth CDW layer, sustaining a local maximum in the eddy kinetic energy over the slope and balancing the Coriolis force associated with the shoreward CDW transport. The resulting slope turbulence self-organizes into a series of alternating along-slope jets with strongly asymmetrical contributions to the slope energy and momentum budgets. Cross-shore variations in the potential vorticity gradient cause the jets to drift continuously offshore, suggesting that fronts observed in regions of AABW down-slope flow may in fact be transient features.\\nC1 [Stewart, Andrew L.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.\\n   [Thompson, Andrew F.] CALTECH, Environm Sci & Engn, Pasadena, CA USA.\\nRP Stewart, AL (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.\\nEM astewart@atmos.ucla.edu\\nOI Stewart, Andrew/0000-0001-5861-4070\\nFU NSF [OCE-1538702, OPP-124646]; Directorate For Geosciences [1246460]\\n   Funding Source: National Science Foundation\\nFX ALS\\'s research was supported by NSF Award OCE-1538702.

Intensified diffusivity exceeding the order of 10(-3) m(2)/s in magnitude was found over the first half of October 2014, and from 2 December 2014 to 21 January 2015 (a typical wintertime). Strong internal tides and winds in winter were the likely candidates for the high-level diapycnal mixing in winter. As for the enhanced mixing during October 2014, we suspect the generation of near-bottom near-inertial waves through the interaction of mesoscale eddies and unique bottom topography was the cause.\\nC1 [Sun, Hui; Yang, Qingxuan; Zhao, Wei; Tian, Jiwei] Ocean Univ China, Phys Oceanog Lab, Qingdao, Peoples R China.\\n   [Liang, Xinfeng] Univ S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, St Petersburg, FL USA.\\nRP Yang, QX (通讯作者)，Ocean Univ China, Phys Oceanog Lab, Qingdao, Peoples R China.\\nEM yangqx@ouc.edu.cn\\nRI Liang, Xinfeng/B-4716-2014\\nOI Liang, Xinfeng/0000-0002-5628-4896\\nFU Natural Science Foundation of China [41576009]; National Key Basic\\n   Research Program of China [2014CB745003]; NSFC-Shandong Joint Fund for\\n   Marine Science Research Centers [U1406401]; Foundation for Innovative\\n   Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China\\n   [41521091]; Global Change and Air-Sea Interaction Project\\n   [GASI-03-01-01-03, GASI-IPOVAI-01-03]; Open Fund of the Key Laboratory\\n   of Ocean Circulation and Waves, Chinese Academy of Sciences [KLOCW1504]\\nFX This work is supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (grant\\n   41576009), the National Key Basic Research Program of China (grant\\n   2014CB745003), the NSFC-Shandong Joint Fund for Marine Science Research\\n   Centers (grant U1406401), the Foundation for Innovative Research Groups\\n   of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant 41521091),\\n   and the Global Change and Air-Sea Interaction Project (grants\\n   GASI-03-01-01-03 and GASI-IPOVAI-01-03), and the Open Fund of the Key\\n   Laboratory of Ocean Circulation and Waves, Chinese Academy of Sciences\\n   (KLOCW1504).

In situ measurements of subsurface moorings and satellite observations reveal pronounced intraseasonal variability (ISV; 20-90 days) of these zonal currents in the western tropical Pacific Ocean (WTPO). The amplitude of ISV is the largest within the equatorial band exceeding 20 cm s(-1) and decreases to similar to 10 cm s(-1) in the NECC band and further to 4-8 cm s(-1) in the NEC and SECC. The ISV power generally increases from high frequencies to low frequencies and exhibits a peak at 50-60 days in the NECC, SEC, and SECC. These variations are faithfully reproduced by an ocean general circulation model (OGCM) forced by satellite winds, and parallel model experiments are performed to gain insights into the underlying mechanisms. It is found that large-scale ISV (>500 km) is primarily caused by atmospheric intraseasonal oscillations (ISOs), such as the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO), through wind stress forcing. These signals are confined within 10 degrees S-8 degrees N, mainly as baroclinic ocean wave responses to ISO winds. For scales shorter than 200 km, ISV is dominated by ocean internal variabilities with mesoscale structures. They arise from the baroclinic and barotropic instabilities associated with the vertical and horizontal shears of the upper-ocean circulation. The ISV exhibits evident seasonal variation, with larger (smaller) amplitude in boreal winter (summer) in the SEC and SECC.\\nC1 [Wang, Fan; Wang, Jianing] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Key Lab Ocean Circulat & Waves, 7 Nanhai Rd, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China.\\n   [Li, Yuanlong] Univ Colorado Boulder, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Boulder, CO USA.\\nRP Wang, F (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Key Lab Ocean Circulat & Waves, 7 Nanhai Rd, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China.\\nEM fwang@qdio.ac.cn\\nRI Keyes, Dennis/AAZ-9285-2021; Wang, Fan/J-5119-2012; Wang,\\n   Jianing/AAI-5661-2020\\nOI Wang, Fan/0000-0001-5932-7567; Wang, Jianing/0000-0002-8064-8151\\nFU Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences\\n   [XDA11010201]; National Basic Research (973) Program of China\\n   [2012CB417401]; NSFC Innovative Group Grant [41421005]; NSFC-Shandong\\n   Joint Fund for Marine Science Research Centers [U1406401]; National\\n   Science Foundation [CNS-0821794]; University of Colorado\\nFX This research is supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program of\\n   the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDA11010201), the National Basic\\n   Research (973) Program of China through Grant 2012CB417401, the NSFC\\n   Innovative Group Grant (41421005), and the NSFC-Shandong Joint Fund for\\n   Marine Science Research Centers (U1406401).

Significant correlations of altimeter-derived SLA on the west coast are found with the mid-basin SLA east of Sri Lanka and SLA as far as Sumatra and the equator, with increased lags, connecting with the remote forcing from the equator in the form of reflected Rossby waves. The highest correlations between SLA on the west coast and winds are found with the winds at the southern tip of India. Coherence calculations help to identify the importance of a narrow band (40-60 day) for the interactions of winds with the intra-seasonal SLA variations. A multivariate regression model, along with the coherences within this narrower band, suggest the lags of SLA on the west coast with winds to range from 0 to 2 days with the local forcing to 11-13 days with the forcing along south east coast of India. Hovmoller diagrams illustrate the propagation of signals by estimating phase speed for Rossby waves (57 cm/s) across the Indian Ocean from Sumatra and Coastal Trapped Waves (CTWs) along the west coast of India (178 cm/s). Propagation from the south-east coast of India is not as robust as Rossby waves from Sumatra.\\nC1 [Dhage, Laxmikant; Strub, P.

Although the GS transport intensity presents a clear interannual variability, satellite observations reveal its mean path is stable. Numerical models can simulate some characteristics of the mean GS path, but persistent biases keep the GS separation and postseparation unstable and therefore unrealistic. This study investigates how the integration of ocean surface currents into the ocean-atmosphere coupling interface of numerical models impacts the GS. The authors show for the first time that the current feedback, through its eddy killing effect, stabilizes the GS separation and postseparation, resolving long-lasting biases in modeled GS path, at least for the Regional Oceanic Modeling System (ROMS). This key process should therefore be taken into account in oceanic numerical models. Using a set of oceanic and atmospheric coupled and uncoupled simulations, this study shows that the current feedback, by modulating the energy transfer from the atmosphere to the ocean, has two main effects on the ocean. On one hand, by reducing the mean surface stress and thus weakening the mean geostrophic wind work by 30%, the current feedback slows down the whole North Atlantic oceanic gyre, making the GS narrower and its transport weaker. Yet, on the other hand, the current feedback acts as an oceanic eddy killer, reducing the surface eddy kinetic energy by 27%. By inducing a surface stress curl opposite to the current vorticity, it deflects energy from the geostrophic current into the atmosphere and dampens eddies.\\nC1 [Renault, Lionel; Molemaker, M.

An existing, empirical shoreline equilibrium model, driven with wave conditions estimated using a regional buoy network, simulates well the seasonal changes in subaerial beach width (e.g. the cross-shore location of the MSL contour) during non-El Nino years, similar to previous results with a 5-year time series lacking an El Nino winter. The existing model correctly identifies the 1997-98 El Nino winter conditions as more erosive than 2009-10, but overestimates shoreline erosion during both El Ninos. The good skill of the existing equilibrium model in typical conditions does not necessarily extrapolate to extreme erosion on these beaches where a few meters thick sand layer often overlies more resistant layers. The modest over-prediction of the 2009-10 El Nino is reduced by gradually decreasing the model mobility of highly eroded shorelines (simulating cobbles, kelp wrack, shell hash, or other stabilizing layers). Over prediction during the more severe 1997-98 El Nino is corrected by stopping model erosion when resilient surfaces (identified with aerial imagery) are reached. The trained model provides a computationally simple (e.g. nonlinear first order differential equation) representation of the observed relationship between incident waves and shoreline change.

The long-term trends and seasonal evolutions of ice concentration, composite albedo, and ice albedo were then obtained. In July-August 1982-2009, the linear trend of the composite albedo and the ice albedo was -0.069 and -0.046 units per decade, respectively. During 1 June to 19 August, melting of sea ice resulted in an increase of solar heat input to the ice-ocean system by 282 MJ.m(-2) from 1982 to 2009. However, because of the counter-balancing effects of the loss of sea ice area and the enhanced ice surface melting, the trend of solar heat input to the ice was insignificant. The summer evolution of ice albedo matched the ice surface melting and ponding well at basin scale. The ice albedo showed a large difference between the multiyear and first-year ice because the latter melted completely by the end of a melt season. At the SHEBA geolocations, a distinct change in the ice albedo has occurred since 2007, because most of the multiyear ice has been replaced by first-year ice. A positive polarity in the Arctic Dipole Anomaly could be partly responsible for the rapid loss of summer ice within the study region in the recent years by bringing warmer air masses from the south and advecting more ice toward the north. Both these effects would enhance ice-albedo feedback.\\nC1 [Lei, Ruibo; Zhang, Zhanhai] Polar Res Inst China, State Ocean Adm, Key Lab Polar Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China.\\n   [Tian-Kunze, Xiangshan; Kaleschke, Lars] Univ Hamburg, Inst Oceanog, Hamburg, Germany.\\n   [Lepparanta, Matti] Univ Helsinki, Dept Phys, Helsinki, Finland.\\n   [Wang, Jia] NOAA, Great Lakes Environm Res Lab, 2205 Commonwealth Blvd, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USA.\\nRP Lei, RB (通讯作者)，Polar Res Inst China, State Ocean Adm, Key Lab Polar Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China.\\nEM leiruibo@pric.org.cn\\nRI Keyes, Dennis/AAZ-9285-2021; Lepparanta, Matti/M-7507-2017\\nOI Kaleschke, Lars/0000-0001-7086-3299; Lepparanta,\\n   Matti/0000-0002-4754-5564; Tian-Kunze, Xiangshan/0000-0001-8270-1924\\nFU National Natural Science Foundation of China [41476170]; Chinese Polar\\n   Environment Comprehensive Investigation and Assessment Programs\\n   [CHINARE2016-03-01/04-03/ 04-04]; Chinese Arctic and Antarctic\\n   Administration [IC2014007]; Nordic Center of Excellence\\n   Cryosphere-Atmosphere Interactions in a Changing Arctic Climate\\n   (CRAICC); NOAA CPO Office of Arctic Research through RUSALCA project\\n   [1821]; DFG [EXC177]\\nFX This work was financially supported by grants from the National Natural\\n   Science Foundation of China (41476170), Chinese Polar Environment\\n   Comprehensive Investigation and Assessment Programs\\n   (CHINARE2016-03-01/04-03/ 04-04), and Chinese Arctic and Antarctic\\n   Administration (IC2014007).

The National Response Center (NRCen) oil pollution reports were collected and filtered for the period of 2001 to 2012 to determine which of the reports coincided with archived SAR images. Some of the images covered multiple reports and some of the oil discharges described in one report could be observed in more than one image. In all, 177 reports could be investigated from 137 SAR images collected on or near the corresponding report dates. Further analysis found that oil slicks observed in 66 of these SAR images could be attributed to 67 of the reported incidents. Objective measurements indicated that the area of these transient oil slicks visible in SAR images was, on average, significantly larger than what was reported to the NRCen. The only recurring point source for oil slicks was the former site of the Taylor offshore platform. Here chronic, oil slicks were observed that were consistently much larger than other anthropogenic discharges. The SAR images of floating oil discharged from the Taylor site were verified by visual inspection from a boat and aerial photography. For some of the oil slicks discharged from the Taylor site, the accuracy of SAR images for detecting oil slick areas was validated by comparing SAR results to Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images. These results show that surveillance by SAR would improve accuracy for estimates of chronic anthropogenic oil pollution, particularly where continuous discharges are on-going.

Evidence of petroleum-derived carbon entering the offshore planktonic foodweb, as well as widespread oiling of coastal areas documented in previous studies suggests that hydrocarbons could have entered the near shore foodweb. To test this hypothesis, we measured radiocarbon (Delta C-14%) and stable carbon isotopes (delta C-13) in an assortment of fish tissue, invertebrate tissue and shell samples collected within a year of the spill at seven sites from Louisiana to Florida USA across the northern Gulf of Mexico. We observed a west-east gradient with the most depleted radiocarbon values found in Terrebonne Bay, Louisana and increasingly enriched radiocarbon values in organisms collected at sites to the east. Depleted radiocarbon values as low as - 10% in invertebrate soft tissue from Terrebonne suggest assimilation of fossil carbon (2.8 +/- 1.2%), consistent with the hypothesis that organic matter from petrochemical reservoirs released during the Deepwater Horizon spill entered the coastal food web to a limited extent. Further there was a significant correlation between radiocarbon and delta C-13 values in invertebrate tissue consistent with this hypothesis. Both oyster tissue and hard head catfish tissue collected in impacted areas of coastal Louisiana were significantly depleted in C-14 and C-13 relative to organisms collected in the unaffected Apalachicola Bay, Florida (p < 0.014). Alternative explanations for these results include the influence of chronic hydrocarbon pollution along the western gulf coast or that the organisms ingest carbon derived from C-14 depleted organic matter mobilized during the erosion of coastal marshes in southern Louisiana.

This paper focuses on a weeklong summer program offered by a minority-serving community college in partnership with a research university. To evaluate program efficacy, we developed a nine-question survey to measure familiarity with geoscience majors, perceptions about geoscience, self-efficacy, and desire to pursue geoscience majors and careers. Sixty-four students participated in the program over a three-year period. Approximately two-thirds of students are from groups that are underrepresented in STEM and approximately one-third is Native Hawaiian. Only a small number of these students expressed interest in geoscience majors prior to program participation, and many were not even aware that geoscience majors existed. By the end of the weeklong program, the students showed learning gains on all nine questions, and eight of these gains were statistically significant. To date, five summer bridge alumni (four Native Hawaiian) have declared geoscience majors, representing 31% of the University of Hawai\\'i at Manoa\\'s Native Hawaiian geoscience enrollment. This suggests that partnering with a minority-serving community college may be an effective, time-efficient way of increasing minority enrollment in geoscience majors.\\nC1 [Bruno, Barbara C.; Wren, Johanna L.

The three locations represent distinct dynamical regimes: a tightly confined jet in a channel; a freely meandering jet; and a topographically controlled jet on a boundary. Despite these differing dynamical regimes, the Gulf Stream in these areas exhibits many similarities. There are also anticipated and important differences, such as the loss of the warm core of the current by 42 degrees N and the decrease in the cross-frontal gradient of potential vorticity as the current flows northward. As the Gulf Stream evolves it undergoes major changes in transport, both in magnitude and structure. The rate of inflow up to 60 degrees W and outflow thereafter are generally uniform, but do exhibit some remarkable short-scale variations. As the Gulf Stream flows northward the vertical coherence of the flow changes, with the Florida Current and North Atlantic Current segments of the Gulf Stream exhibiting distinct upper and deep flows that are incoherent, while in the Mid-Atlantic Bight the Gulf Stream exhibits flows in three layers each of which tends to be incoherent with the other layers at most periods. These coherence characteristics are exhibited in both Eulerian and stream coordinates. The observed lack of vertical coherence indicates that great caution must be exercised in interpreting proxies for Gulf Stream structure and flow from vertically-limited or remote observations.

Two branches of SCSTF, the Karimata-Sunda Strait ThroughFlow (KSSTF) and the Mindoro Strait ThroughFlow (MSTF), are examined. Using the ensemble empirical mode decomposition method (EEMD), time series of pressure difference and volume transport are decomposed into intrinsic mode functions and trend functions, with the corresponding variability on different time scales. Pressure difference agrees with the KSSTF volume transport on decadal time scale; while for the MSTF, pressure difference varies similarly with volume transport on interannual time scale. Separating the dynamic height difference into the thermal and haline terms, for the KSSTF more than half of the dynamic height difference (32 cm) is due to the thermal contributions; while the remaining dynamic height difference (23 cm) is due to the haline contributions. For the MSTF, the dynamic height difference (29 cm) is primarily due to the thermal contribution (26 cm).\\nC1 [Qin, Huiling; Huang, Rui Xin; Wang, Weiqiang; Xue, Huijie] Chinese Acad Sci, SCSIO, State Key Lab Trop Oceanog, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.\\n   [Huang, Rui Xin] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Phys Oceanog, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\n   [Xue, Huijie] Univ Maine, Sch Marine Sci, Orono, ME USA.\\nRP Wang, WQ (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, SCSIO, State Key Lab Trop Oceanog, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.\\nEM weiqiang.wang@scsio.ac.cn\\nRI Xue, Huijie/AAJ-2877-2020; Wang, Weiqiang/B-1776-2013\\nOI Xue, Huijie/0000-0003-0738-4978; Wang, Weiqiang/0000-0003-2146-4210\\nFU Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA11010304]; National Natural Science\\n   Foundation of China [41306015, 41476013]; Independent Research Project\\n   Program of State Key Laboratory of Tropical Oceanography [LTOZZ1603]\\nFX Both ORAS4 and SODA are available on the server of the Asia-Pacific Data\\n   Research Center (APDRC) of the International Pacific Research Centre\\n   (IPRC).

However, in many continental margin settings, reduced carbon can also be added to sediments from below-for example, from \"deep\" geologic hydrocarbon reservoirs derived from ancient source rocks or from the decomposition of deeply buried gas hydrate deposits. To examine the impact of these two differing reduced carbon inputs on sediment biogeochemistry, a modified reaction-transport model for anoxic marine sediments is described here and applied to data from sediment cores in Santa Barbara Basin to a depth of 4.6 m. Excellent model fits yield results consistent with previous studies of Santa Barbara Basin and other continental margin sediments. These results indicate that authigenic carbonate precipitation in these sediments is not centered around the sulfate-methane transition zone (SMTZ), as is seen in many other sedimentary environments but occurs at shallower depths in the sediments and over a relatively broad depth range. Sulfate profiles are linear between the surface sediments (upper similar to 20 cm) and the top of the SMTZ (similar to 105 cm) giving the appearance of refractory particulate organic carbon (POC) burial and conservative sulfate behavior in this intermediate region. However, model results show that linear profiles may also occur when high rates of sulfate reduction occur near the sediment surface (as organoclastic sulfate reduction [oSR]) and in the SMTZ (largely as anaerobic oxidation of methane) with low, but nonzero, rates of oSR in-between. At the same time, linearity in the sulfate profile may also be related to downward pore-water advection by compaction and sedimentation plus a decrease with depth in sulfate diffusivity because of decreasing porosity. These model-determined rates of oSR and methanogenesis also result in a rate of POC loss that declines near-continuously in a logarithmic fashion over the entire sediment column studied. The results presented further here indicate the importance of a deep methane flux from below on sediment biogeochemistry in the shallower sediments, although the exact source of this methane flux is difficult to ascertain with the existing data.\\nC1 [Burdige, David J.] Old Dominion Univ, Dept Ocean Earth & Atmospher Sci, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA.\\n   [Komada, Tomoko] San Francisco State Univ, Romberg Tiburon Ctr, 3150 Paradise Dr, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA.\\n   [Magen, Cedric] Univ Maryland, Chesapeake Biol Lab, 146 Williams St,POB 38, Solomons, MD 20688 USA.\\n   [Magen, Cedric; Chanton, Jeffrey P.] Florida State Univ, Dept Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, P Box 3064520, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.\\nRP Burdige, DJ (通讯作者)，Old Dominion Univ, Dept Ocean Earth & Atmospher Sci, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA.\\nEM dburdige@odu.edu\\nRI Burdige, David/AAI-1073-2019\\nOI Magen, Cedric/0000-0003-0758-2675; Burdige, David/0000-0002-8859-7096\\nFU National Science Foundation [OCE-1155562, OCE-1155764, OCE-1155320]\\nFX We thank all the people who assisted us in collection of the data we\\n   have examined here, including the captain and crew of R/V Robert Gordon\\n   Sproul and R/V New Horizon and Scripps Institution of Oceanography\\n   marine technicians L.

A prey-field mapping cruise took place in the fall between 15 September 2008 and 1 October 2008, consisting of a series of transects and \"clovers\" to study the spatial and temporal variability. The region is characterized by a deep scattering layer (DSL), which is preyed on by nekton that serves as the food for beaked whale and other whale species. This study marks the first of its kind where concurrent measurements of acoustic backscatter and turbulence have been conducted for a nekton scattering layer well below the euphotic zone. Turbulence data collected from a Deep Microstructure Profiler are compared to biological and shear data collected by a 38 kHz Simrad EK 60 echo sounder and a hydrographic Doppler sonar system, respectively. From these measurements, the primary processes responsible for the turbulent production in the TOTO region are assessed. The DSL around 500 m and a surface scattering layer (SSL) are investigated for raised epsilon values. Strong correlation between turbulence levels and scattering intensity of prey is generally found in the SSL with dissipation levels as large as similar to 10(-7) W kg(-1), 3 orders of magnitude above background levels. In the DSL and during the diel vertical migration, dissipation levels similar to 10(-8) W kg(-1) were observed.\\nC1 [Hooper, James A.; Baringer, Molly O.] NOAA, AOML, PHOD, 4301 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA.\\n   [Hooper, James A.] Univ Miami, CIMAS, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL USA.\\n   [St Laurent, Louis C.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Phys Oceanog, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\n   [Dewar, William K.] Florida State Univ, Dept Oceanog, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.\\n   [Nowacek, Doug] Duke Univ, Marine Lab, Nicholas Sch Environm, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA.\\n   [Nowacek, Doug] Duke Univ, Marine Lab, Pratt Sch Engn, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA.\\nRP Hooper, JA (通讯作者)，NOAA, AOML, PHOD, 4301 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA.; Hooper, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Miami, CIMAS, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL USA.\\nEM james.hooper@noaa.gov\\nRI Baringer, Molly O/D-2277-2012\\nOI Baringer, Molly O/0000-0002-8503-5194\\nFU Cooperative Institute of Marine and Atmospheric Studies (CIMAS), a\\n   Cooperative Institute of the University of Miami; National Oceanic and\\n   Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) [NA10OAR4320143]; NOAA/OAR\\'s Atlantic\\n   Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory; U.S. Office of Naval\\n   Research [N00014-08-1-1162-01]\\nFX This research was also carried out in part under the auspices of the\\n   Cooperative Institute of Marine and Atmospheric Studies (CIMAS), a\\n   Cooperative Institute of the University of Miami, and the National\\n   Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), cooperative agreement\\n   NA10OAR4320143.

Two controls on chlorophyll concentrations in this deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) layer are noted: chlorophyll concentration is controlled by nutrients at low nutrient concentrations and by light when nutrients are saturating. To synthesize these results, a simple one-dimensional nutrient-phytoplankton model is developed by including the effects of phytoplankton self-shading for light attenuation, depth-dependent phytoplankton specific loss, and density-associated nutrient fluctuation in the deep layer. The model is parameterized using eddy data including not only vertical diffusivity, sinking velocity, and chlorophyll-to-carbon ratios, but also rates of phytoplankton growth and nutrient regeneration. Our results suggest that the observed DCM variability is controlled by nutrient-light interaction leading to a change of phytoplankton physiology and hence vertical enrichment of chlorophyll within the core of the stratified eddy. Further theoretical analyses indicate that variation of nutrient and light availability in the DCM layer of the eddy core is largely driven by change of the vertical nutrient fluxes as a result of isopycnal motions in the deep layer, which is also subject to influences by processes including vertical mixing, particle sinking, and nutrient regeneration.\\nC1 [Li, Qian P.] Chinese Acad Sci, South China Sea Inst Oceanol, State Key Lab Trop Oceanog, 164 Xingang Rd, Guangzhou 510301, Peoples R China.\\n   [Hansell, Dennis A.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Dept Ocean Sci, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA.\\nRP Li, QP (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, South China Sea Inst Oceanol, State Key Lab Trop Oceanog, 164 Xingang Rd, Guangzhou 510301, Peoples R China.\\nEM qianli@scsio.ac.cn\\nRI Li, Qian P/P-7335-2018; Hansell, Dennis A./AAC-1271-2019\\nOI Li, Qian P/0000-0002-9846-3243; Hansell, Dennis A./0000-0001-9275-3445\\nFU National 1000-Talent Recruitment Program of China; National Key Research\\n   and Development Program of China [2016YFC0301202]; U.S. National Science\\n   Foundation [OCE-0241340, OCE-0752972]; Directorate For Geosciences\\n   [1436748] Funding Source: National Science Foundation\\nFX We thank Peter Franks for constructive comments on the manuscript.

The LES solves the wave-averaged, or Craik-Leibovich, equations in order to account for the Stokes forces that result from interactions between nonbreaking surface waves and currents, and resolves both submesoscale eddies and boundary layer turbulence down to 4.9 m x 4.9 m x 1.25 m grid scales. It is found that submesoscale frontogenesis differs from traditional frontogenesis theory due to four effects: Stokes forces, momentum and kinetic energy transfer from submesoscale eddies to frontal secondary circulations, resolved turbulent stresses, and unbalanced torque. In the energy, momentum, angular momentum, and vorticity budgets for the frontal overturning circulation, the Stokes shear force is a leading-order contributor, typically either the second or third largest source of frontal overturning. These effects violate hydrostatic and thermal wind balances during submesoscale frontogenesis. The effect of the Stokes shear force becomes stronger with increasing alignment of the front and Stokes shear and with a nondimensional scaling. The Stokes shear force and momentum transfer from submesoscale eddies significantly energize the frontal secondary circulation along with the buoyancy.\\nC1 [Suzuki, Nobuhiro; Fox-Kemper, Baylor] Brown Univ, Dept Earth Environm & Planetary Sci, Providence, RI 02912 USA.\\n   [Hamlington, Peter E.] Univ Colorado, Dept Mech Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.\\n   [Van Roekel, Luke P.] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Theoret Div, Climate Ocean & Sea Ice Modeling, Los Alamos, NM USA.\\nRP Suzuki, N (通讯作者)，Brown Univ, Dept Earth Environm & Planetary Sci, Providence, RI 02912 USA.\\nEM nobuhiro_suzuki@brown.edu\\nRI Fox-Kemper, Baylor/A-1159-2007\\nOI Fox-Kemper, Baylor/0000-0002-2871-2048; Suzuki,\\n   Nobuhiro/0000-0002-7813-0118\\nFU Brown University; Rhode Island Science & Technology Advisory Council;\\n   Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative; NSF [1258907, 1258995]; Directorate\\n   For Geosciences [1258995, 1258907] Funding Source: National Science\\n   Foundation\\nFX The authors would like to acknowledge fruitful conversations with Eric\\n   D\\'Asaro, Sean Haney, and James McWilliams.

It also provided an opportunity to obtain detailed information on the seafloor morphology and shallow stratigraphy of this understudied region. The seafloor exhibited two morphologies: (1) small-scale (< 2 m) bare-rock karstic features, and (2) thin (< 1 m) linear sand accumulations overlying the bedrock. Solution pans, circular to oblong depressions featured flat bottoms and steep sides, were the dominant karstic features; they are known to form subaerially by the pooling of rainwater and dissolution of carbonate. Observed pans were 10-50 cm deep and generally 1-8 m wide, but occasionally reach 15 m, significantly larger than any solution pan observed on land (maximum 6 m). These features likely grew over the course of many 10\\'s of thousands of years in an arid environment while subaerially exposed during lowered sea levels. Surface sands are organized into linear bedforms oriented NE-SW, 10\\'s to 100\\'s meters wide, and kilometers long. These features are identified as sand ribbons (longitudinal bedforms), and contained asymmetric secondary transverse bedforms that indicate NE-directed flow. This orientation is incompatible with the prevalent westward current direction; we hypothesize that these features are storm-generated. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on scarce cruise and mooring data, previous studies differentiated a trade wind situation (austral winter) when the New Guinea Coastal Current (NGCC) flows northwestward and a northwest monsoon situation (austral summer) when a coastal upwelling develops and the NGCC reverses. This circulation pattern is confirmed by satellite observations, except in Vitiaz Strait where the surface northwestward flow persists. We find that intraseasonal and seasonal time scale variations explain most of the variance north of New Guinea. SST and chlorophyll variabilities are mainly driven by two processes: penetration of Solomon Sea waters and coastal upwelling. In the trade wind situation, the NGCC transports cold Solomon Sea waters through Vitiaz Strait in a narrow vein hugging the coast. Coastal upwelling is generated in westerly wind situations (westerly wind event, northwest monsoon). Highly productive coastal waters are advected toward the equator and, during some westerly wind events, toward the eastern part of the warm pool. During El Nino, coastal upwelling events and northward penetration of Solomon Sea waters combine to influence SST and chlorophyll anomalies.\\nC1 [Radenac, Marie-Helene; Leger, Fabien; Eldin, Gerard] Univ Toulouse, CNRS, LEGOS, CNES,IRD,UPS, Toulouse, France.\\n   [Leger, Fabien] Meteo France, CNRS, UMR3589, CNRM GAME, Toulouse, France.\\n   [Messie, Monique] Monterey Bay Aquarium Res Inst, Monterey, CA USA.\\n   [Dutrieux, Pierre] Univ Washington, Appl Phys Lab, Polar Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.\\n   [Menkes, Christophe] Ctr Noumea, IRD LOCEAN, Noumea, New Caledonia.\\nRP Radenac, MH (通讯作者)，Univ Toulouse, CNRS, LEGOS, CNES,IRD,UPS, Toulouse, France.\\nEM marie-helene.radenac@legos.obs-mip.fr\\nRI menkes, christophe/H-9085-2016; Léger, Fabien/CAH-0849-2022; Messié,\\n   Monique/K-2022-2012; Messié, Monique/AGO-6508-2022; Dutrieux,\\n   Pierre/B-7568-2012; menkes, christophe/X-6073-2019; Léger,\\n   Fabien/G-7125-2018\\nOI menkes, christophe/0000-0002-1457-9696; Léger,\\n   Fabien/0000-0002-2085-5204; Messié, Monique/0000-0002-4985-3413; Messié,\\n   Monique/0000-0002-4985-3413; Dutrieux, Pierre/0000-0002-8066-934X;\\n   menkes, christophe/0000-0002-1457-9696; Léger,\\n   Fabien/0000-0002-2085-5204\\nFU CNES\\nFX Several freely available data contributed to this study.

This implementation is performed within the scope of The Santos Basin Ocean Observing System (or Project Azul), a pilot project designed to collect oceanographic data with enough frequency and spatial coverage so to improve regional forecasts through data assimilation. The ocean modeling and data assimilation system of Project Azul is performed with the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS). The observations used in the assimilation cycles include the following: 1-day gridded, 0.1A degrees resolution SST from POES AVHRR; 1-day gridded, 0.3A degrees composite of the MDT SSH from AVISO; and surface and subsurface hydrographic measurements of temperature and salinity collected with gliders and ARGO floats from Project Azul and from UK Met-Office EN3 project dataset. The assimilative model results are compared to forward model results and independent observations, both from remote sensing and in situ sources. The results clearly show that 4D-Var data assimilation leads to an improvement in the skill of ocean hindcast in the studied region.\\nC1 [Fragoso, Mauricio da Rocha; de Carvalho, Gabriel Vieira; Mendes Soares, Felipe Lobo] Prooceano Serv Oceanog, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.\\n   [Faller, Daiane Gracieli; Toste, Raquel; Barbosa Sancho, Livia Maria; Passos, Elisa Nobrega; Boeck, Carina Stefoni; Reis, Bruna; Landau, Luiz] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, LAMCE COPPE, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.\\n   [de Freitas Assad, Luiz Paulo] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Dept Meteorol, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.\\n   [Arango, Hernan G.] Rutgers State Univ, Inst Marine & Coastal Sci, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USA.\\n   [Moore, Andrew M.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ocean Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.\\nRP Fragoso, MD (通讯作者)，Prooceano Serv Oceanog, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.\\nEM mauricio@prooceano.com.br\\nRI Sancho, Lívia/AHB-0678-2022; Landau, Luiz/ABH-2897-2021; de Assad, Luiz\\n   Paulo/AAL-1599-2021\\nOI Sancho, Lívia/0000-0001-9925-4841; Landau, Luiz/0000-0001-7857-9946;\\n   Toste, Raquel/0000-0002-3104-3236; Franca, Bruna/0000-0001-5149-8118\\nFU BG Brazil in the scope of ANP Research and Development program\\nFX Project Azul is funded by BG Brazil in the scope of ANP Research and\\n   Development program.\\nNR 41\\nTC 13\\nZ9 13\\nU1 0\\nU2 10\\nPU SPRINGER HEIDELBERG\\nPI HEIDELBERG\\nPA TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY\\nSN 1616-7341\\nEI 1616-7228\\nJ9 OCEAN DYNAM\\nJI Ocean Dyn.\\nPD MAR\\nPY 2016\\nVL 66\\nIS 3\\nBP 419\\nEP 434\\nDI 10.1007/s10236-016-0931-5\\nPG 16\\nWC Oceanography\\nWE Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)\\nSC Oceanography\\nGA DF8UR\\nUT WOS:000371635900008\\nDA 2022-06-16\\nER\\n\\nPT J\\nAU Perry, MJ\\nAF Perry, Mary Jane\\nTI The Optical Oceanography Class Turned 30 in Summer 2015\\nSO OCEANOGRAPHY\\nLA English\\nDT Editorial Material\\nC1 [Perry, Mary Jane] Univ Maine, Darling Marine Ctr, Sch Marine Sci, Walpole, ME 04573 USA.\\nRP Perry, MJ (通讯作者)，Univ Maine, Darling Marine Ctr, Sch Marine Sci, Walpole, ME 04573 USA.\\nEM perrymj@maine.edu\\nNR 1\\nTC 1\\nZ9 1\\nU1 0\\nU2 1\\nPU OCEANOGRAPHY SOC\\nPI ROCKVILLE\\nPA P.O.

The platform reef is 200 m across, 700 m long, and the water depth varies from 0.3 to 1.2 m. Assuming changes in wave energy flux are due to wave breaking and bottom drag dissipation, the wave transformation model with optimal parameters characterizing the wave breaking ((m)=0.25) and bottom drag (hydrodynamic roughness z(o)=0.08 m) accounts for 75%-90% of the observed wave-height variance at four sites. The observations and model indicate that wave breaking dominates the dissipation in a 20-30 m wide surf zone while bottom drag dominates the dissipation over the rest of the reef. Friction factors (drag coefficients) estimated from the observed wave energy balance range from f(w)=0.5 to f(w)=5 and increase as wave-orbital displacements decrease. The observed dependence on wave-orbital displacement is roughly consistent with extrapolation of an empirical relationship based on numerous laboratory studies of oscillatory flow. As a consequence of the dependence on wave-orbital displacement, wave friction factors vary temporally due to changes in water depth and incident wave heights, and spatially across the reef as the waves decay.\\nC1 [Lentz, S.

A suite of MM samples from the coastal area of the East China Sea (ECS) was collected in spring and summer of 2011 to observe their spatial and temporal distribution, grain size, and radionuclides concentrations. The MM thickness ranged from 0.5 to 11 cm (average: 2.2 cm (May) and 3.9 cm (August)). The thick mud layer is mainly distributed along the coast, with an area of 2.2 x 10(4) km(2) in May and 1.5 x 10(4) km(2) in August, with corresponding masses of 8.8 x 10(8) and 7.8 x 10(8) t, respectively. The estimated masses of MM are considerably larger than the annual sediment discharge mass of the Changjiang River. The distribution of Cs-137 inventories in MM indicates that Cs-137 can be effectively utilized as a transport tracer of MM in the river-dominated estuaries and coastal areas. The higher inventories of Be-7 in MM in the river mouth in spring are attributed to higher depositional flux and higher sediment discharge. The ratio of the MM inventory of Th-234(ex)/production in the overlying water column of >2.5 in south inshore indicates that the sediment focusing resulted in the increased mass flux. The residence time of MM is estimated as 3-6 years both by mass balance of MM and Pb-210(ex) in MM.\\nC1 [Wang, Jinlong; Du, Jinzhou; Zhang, Jing] E China Normal Univ, State Key Lab Estuarine & Coastal Res, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China.\\n   [Baskaran, Mark] Wayne State Univ, Dept Geol, Detroit, MI USA.\\nRP Du, JZ (通讯作者)，E China Normal Univ, State Key Lab Estuarine & Coastal Res, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China.\\nEM jzdu@sklec.ecnu.edu.cn\\nRI Baskaran, Mark/AAN-2253-2020\\nOI Baskaran, Mark/0000-0002-2218-4328\\nFU Ministry of Science and Technology of PR China [2011CB409801]; Natural\\n   Science Foundation of China [41021064]; \"High-end Foreign Experts\\n   Recruitment Program\\'\\' - State Administration of Foreign Affairs (P.R.\\n   China)\\nFX The data reported in this paper can be obtained by contacting the\\n   corresponding author Jinzhou Du (jzdu@sklec.ecnu.edu.cn).

Meteotsunami height data are fit with Pareto Type 1 and Generalized Pareto Distributions to estimate exceedance probabilities. The annual meteotsunami return level exceeds 0.25 m at all but two stations, with the largest annual return level of 0.62 m at Calumet Harbor. Analysis of radar imagery indicates that Lake Michigan meteotsunamis are associated primarily with convective storm structures, with a considerable contribution from frontal storms as well. Meteotsunami association with convective storm structures is more prevalent in southern Lake Michigan while frontal storm structures have a greater association with meteotsunamis in northern Lake Michigan. Water depths in southern Lake Michigan are conducive to Proudman resonance with convective storms while the northern Lake Michigan is too deep to meet Proudman resonance criteria, suggesting Greenspan edge wave resonance as the likely generation mechanism. Interestingly, meteotsunami events occur primarily in the late spring and early summer, approximately 1 month before the peak convective storm season but after the peak cyclone season. Overall, this statistical analysis provides valuable insight into the spatial and temporal trends in meteotsunami occurrence in Lake Michigan needed to estimate the risk posed by these dangerous coastal hazards.\\nC1 [Bechle, Adam J.; Wu, Chin H.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Madison, WI 53706 USA.\\n   [Kristovich, David A.

A preindustrial control simulation of an eddying climate model coupled to a biogeochemical model [GFDL Climate Model, version 2.6 (CM2.6)- simplified version of the Biogeochemistry with Light Iron Nutrients and Gas (miniBLING) 0.1 degrees ocean model] is used to investigate the transport of heat, carbon, oxygen, and phosphate across the PF core, with a particular focus on the role of mesoscale eddies. The authors find that the total transport across the PF core results from a ubiquitous Ekman transport that drives the upwelled tracers to the north and a localized opposing eddy transport that induces tracer leakages to the south at major topographic obstacles. In the Ekman layer, the southward eddy transport only partially compensates the northward Ekman transport, while below the Ekman layer, the southward eddy transport dominates the total transport but remains much smaller in magnitude than the near-surface northward transport. Most of the southward branch of the total transport is achieved below the PF core, mainly through geostrophic currents. This study finds that the eddy-diffusive transport reinforces the southward eddy-advective transport for carbon and heat, and opposes it for oxygen and phosphate. Eddy-advective transport is likely to be the leading-order component of eddy-induced transport for all four tracers. However, eddy-diffusive transport may provide a significant contribution to the southward eddy heat transport due to strong along-isopycnal temperature gradients.\\nC1 [Dufour, Carolina O.; de Souza, Gregory F.; Frenger, Ivy; Morrison, Adele K.; Sarmiento, Jorge L.; Slater, Richard D.] Princeton Univ, Atmospher & Ocean Sci Program, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.\\n   [Griffies, Stephen M.; Dunne, John P.; Anderson, Whit G.] NOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ USA.\\n   [Palter, Jaime B.] McGill Univ, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada.\\n   [Galbraith, Eric D.] McGill Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada.\\nRP Dufour, CO (通讯作者)，Program Atmospher & Ocean Sci, 300 Forrestal Rd,Sayre Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.\\nEM cdufour@princeton.edu\\nRI Morrison, Adele K/C-1774-2012; Frenger, Ivy/B-9023-2017; Dunne, John\\n   P/F-8086-2012; Griffies, Stephen Matthew/N-9144-2019; Galbraith,\\n   Eric/F-9469-2014\\nOI Morrison, Adele K/0000-0002-9904-4980; Frenger, Ivy/0000-0002-3490-7239;\\n   Dunne, John P/0000-0002-8794-0489; Griffies, Stephen\\n   Matthew/0000-0002-3711-236X; de Souza, Gregory/0000-0002-0232-2690;\\n   Galbraith, Eric/0000-0003-4476-4232; Palter, Jaime/0000-0002-2656-8062;\\n   Dufour, Carolina/0000-0002-1441-3880\\nFU National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) [NNX14AL40G];\\n   Princeton Environmental Institute Grand Challenge initiative; Swiss\\n   National Science Foundation (SNSF) [P300P2-147747]; NASA [NNX14AL40G];\\n   U.S. Department of Energy [DE-SC0012457]; SNSF Early Postdoc Mobility\\n   Fellowship [P2EZP2-152133]; Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate\\n   Observations and Modeling (SOCCOM) project under the National Science\\n   Foundation [PLR-1425989]; Office of Polar Programs (OPP) [1425989]\\n   Funding Source: National Science Foundation\\nFX The CM2.6-miniBLING control simulation was run at GFDL through a large\\n   co-operative effort involving a substantial commitment of computational\\n   resources and data storage.

A three-dimensional fast Fourier transform is employed to obtain the wave number-frequency spectrum of a MR image sequence. Near-surface currents are estimated from the Doppler-shifted surface gravity wave signal within the spectrum. They represent a weighted mean of the upper ocean flow. The longer the ocean waves on which the current estimates are based, the greater their effective depth. The novelty lies in the wave number-dependent retrieval method, yielding approximate to 100 independent current estimates at effective depths from approximate to 2 to 8 m per approximate to 12 min measurement period. First, MR near-surface vertical current shear measurements are presented using data collected from R/V Roger Revelle during the 2010 Impact of Typhoons on the Ocean in the Pacific experiment in the Philippine Sea. Shipboard acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) and anemometer measurements as well as WAVEWATCH III (WW3) model results are used to demonstrate that results are in accord with physical expectations. The wind and wave-driven Ekman flow is obtained by subtracting ADCP-based background currents from the radar measurements. At approximate to 2 m, it is on average approximate to 1.6% of the wind speed and approximate to 38.9 degrees to the right of the wind. With increasing effective depth, the speed factor decreases and the deflection angle increases. Based on WW3 results, the MR-sensed Stokes drift speed is approximate to 50% of the Ekman flow at approximate to 2 m and approximate to 25% at approximate to 8 m. These findings are consistent with previous observations and Ekman theory.\\nC1 [Lund, B.; Graber, H.

Their energetics are notoriously complex, in particular near sloping topography, where the feedback between cross-slope Ekman transports, buoyancy forcing, and mixing affects the energy budget in ways that are not well understood. Here, the authors attempt to clarify the energy pathways and different routes to mixing, using a combined theoretical and modeling approach. The analysis is based on a newly developed energy flux diagram for turbulent Ekman layers near sloping topography that allows for an exact definition of the different energy reservoirs and energy pathways. Using a second-moment turbulence model, it is shown that mixing efficiencies increase for increasing slope angle and interior stratification, but do not exceed the threshold of 5% except for very steep slopes, where the canonical value of 20% may be reached. Available potential energy generated by cross-slope advection may equal up to 70% of the energy lost to dissipation for upwelling-favorable flow, and up to 40% for downwelling-favorable flow.\\nC1 [Umlauf, Lars] Leibniz Inst Baltic Sea Res, D-18119 Warnemunde, Germany.\\n   [Smyth, William D.; Moum, James N.] Oregon State Univ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.\\nRP Umlauf, L (通讯作者)，Leibniz Inst Baltic Sea Res, Seestr 15, D-18119 Warnemunde, Germany.\\nEM lars.umlauf@io-warnemuende.de\\nRI Moum, James N/N-1187-2019; Umlauf, Lars/B-5521-2012\\nOI Umlauf, Lars/0000-0002-6463-6863\\nFU German Research Foundation (DFG) [UM79/6-1]; National Science Foundation\\n   [OCE 1355678, 1256620]; Oregon State University; Office of Naval\\n   Research; Directorate For Geosciences [1256620] Funding Source: National\\n   Science Foundation\\nFX LU is grateful for the support by the German Research Foundation (DFG)\\n   through Grant UM79/6-1.

The Kuroshio exhibits a single velocity maximum south of Luzon Strait, strengthened downstream. It is occasionally accompanied by a second velocity maximum, and the two together form a dual-core structure east of Taiwan. Two possible mechanisms are responsible for the dual-core phenomenon. One is attributed to intrusion of the Kuroshio into the South China Sea through Luzon Strait, which occurs normally during persistent northeasterlies in winter. The streamline diffluence across the strait during the Kuroshio\\'s westward intrusions and subsequent shaping of the boundary current through interaction with a quasi-permanent anticyclonic recirculation east of Taiwan favors the appearance of the offshore velocity maximum. The other possible mechanism is related to the dissipation of westward-propagating mesoscale anticyclonic eddies. As the impinging eddy deforms and is eventually dissipated along the Kuroshio\\'s eastern flank, the northward flow contiguous to the western half of this eddy is enhanced, causing an offshore core downstream. Glider-observed theta-S properties in the dual cores indicate different water masses are mixing, consistent with two different mechanisms causing the dual cores.\\nC1 [Yang, Kai-Chieh; Wang, Joe; Jan, Sen; Yang, Yiing Jang; Chang, Ming-Huei] Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.\\n   [Lee, Craig M.; Ma, Barry; Lien, Ren-Chieh] Univ Washington, Appl Phys Lab, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.\\nRP Yang, KC (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.\\nEM kcyang.apl@gmail.com\\nOI Yang, Yiing-Jang/0000-0002-6637-9311; Wang, Joe/0000-0002-3298-2956;\\n   CHANG, MING-HUEI/0000-0002-6409-7652; Jan, Sen/0000-0002-4128-9715\\nFU Ministry of Science and Technology of the Republic of China (Taiwan)\\n   [MOST-103-2611-M-002-011]; US Office of Naval Research\\n   [N00014-10-1-0308, N00014-10-1-0397]\\nFX This work is supported by grants from the Ministry of Science and\\n   Technology of the Republic of China (Taiwan), MOST-103-2611-M-002-011,\\n   and the US Office of Naval Research, N00014-10-1-0308 (Lee) and\\n   N00014-10-1-0397 (Lien and Ma).

Here we examine the influence of mesoscale eddies on deep-sea subinertial and near-inertial currents, and on possible enhanced oceanic mixing in the deep South China Sea (SCS). We analyzed current velocity data for nearly a full water column. Data were obtained using acoustic Doppler current profilers and recording current meters on a deep-sea mooring system at a depth of 2100 m in the northeastern SCS from October 2012 to May 2013. A highly nonlinear southwestward-propagating anticyclonic eddy was detected via a resolved sea-surface-level anomaly. This eddy induced pronounced subinertial currents with a characteristic time scale of 1-2 months and a maximum velocity of up to 0.2 m s(-1) at the subsurface and 0.1 m s(-1) at great depth. Near-inertial energy co-occurring with subinertial flows showed a distinctive vertical propagation trend during strong subinertial oscillations in the deep sea. During periods of strong subinertial and near-inertial kinetic energy, estimates of diapycnal diffusivity in the deep ocean showed approximately 10-fold enhancement, with a mean value of 1.2 x 10(-3) m(2) s(-4) compared to the background value of 1.4 x 10(-4) m(2) s(-1). The results provide observational evidence of the effect of surface-observed mesoscale motions on benthic currents and ocean mixing in the deep SCS. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

One area of elevated chl a on central Pennell Bank (CPB) appeared to be a recurrent mid-summer feature. The western flank (WF) of Pennell Bank had pronounced signatures of Modified Circumpolar Deep Water (MCDW). We evaluated the spatial extent of Fe limitation and net primary production and tested whether MCDW may provide elevated amounts of Fe to the CPB region, through a combination of in situ measurements, shipboard incubations and a horizontally resolved physical model. Regional fluxes of dissolved Fe from deep to surface waters were compared to calculated Fe demands. Low in situ variable to maximum fluorescence (F-v/F-m; 0.24-0.37) and surface water dissolved Fe concentrations (similar to 0.12-0.21 nM) were suggestive of widespread limitation, corroborated by the consistent responses (F-v/F-m, growth, and nutrient removal ratios) of incubation treatments to Fe addition. MCDW from the WF region had lower dissolved Fe concentrations than that measured in CDW (Circumpolar Deep Water), which suggests on-shelf modification with Fe deplete surface waters and is consistent with the lack of stimulation due to incubation amendments with filtered MCDW. Model results and empirical data suggest MCDW from the WF region is further modified and mixed en route to the CPB region, leading to both the erosion of the canonical MCDW signature and an elevated dissolved Fe inventory of CPB region deep water. This suggests the addition of Fe possibly via diagenesis, as suggested by Marsay et al. (2014). Calculated deep water supply rates to the surface waters of CPB were similar to 0.18-0.43 m d(-1), while calculated rates at the WF or northern Pennell Bank (NPB) regions were negative. The CPB populations exhibited similar to 4.5-fold higher net production rates compared to those in the WF and NPB regions and required 520-3200 nmol Fe m(-2) d(-1). The modeled vertical supply rates seem to provide similar to 2-15% of the estimated Fe requirement. Since this flux is based on subsurface dissolved Fe inventories, it does not account for any bioavailable Fe from deep water particulate sources or for Fe recycling in the upper water column. These data suggest the recurrent productivity hotspots at CPB are not fueled by Fe-rich MCDW but are partially supported by the delivery of Fe through vertical exchange processes.

Shoreward propagating internal bores have been studied with laboratory experiments and numerical models, but few observational studies have shown the detailed structure of the run-up of internal bores induced by internal tides. Our observations showed that internal bores propagate along the slope, accompanied by strong turbulent mixing and strong sediment resuspension in a shallow bay. The isothermal displacement due to the bores reached 20 m vertically in a water depth of 40 m. Turbidity measurements showed suspended particles transported from the sloping bottom and offshore above the thermocline, forming an intermediate nepheloid layer (INL). At the head of the bore (dense water), a vortex accompanied by strong vertical motion induced strong vertical sediment resuspension and a steep isothermal displacement. The rate of turbulent kinetic energy dissipation reached 10(-6) W kg(-1) at the head of the wave. A nonhydrostatic numerical simulation in a two-dimensional domain reproduced fine features associated with the run-up of an internal bore and the vortex motion at its head. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Heaving induced by inter-annual and decadal wind stress perturbations can give rise to anomalous ZOC and ZHF. Based on a simple reduced gravity model, the anomalous ZOC and ZHF induced by idealized heaving modes in the world oceans are studied. For example, in a Pacific-like model basin intensified equatorial easterly on decadal time scales can lead to a negative ZOC with a non-negligible magnitude (-0.3x10(6) m(3)/s) and a considerable westward ZHF with an amplitude of -11.2 TW. Thus, anomalous ZOC and ZHF may consist of a major part of climate signals on decadal time scales and thus play an important role in the oceanic circulation and climate change.\\nC1 [Tan Wei] Hohai Univ, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.\\n   [Huang Rui Xin; Wang Weiqiang; Wang Xin] Chinese Acad Sci, South China Sea Inst Oceanol, State Key Lab Trop Oceanog, Guangzhou 510301, Guangdong, Peoples R China.\\n   [Huang Rui Xin] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\nRP Huang, RX (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, South China Sea Inst Oceanol, State Key Lab Trop Oceanog, Guangzhou 510301, Guangdong, Peoples R China.\\nEM rhuang@whoi.edu\\nRI Wang, Weiqiang/B-1776-2013; Wang, Xin/B-4624-2012\\nOI Wang, Weiqiang/0000-0003-2146-4210; Wang, Xin/0000-0002-7323-2289\\nFU CAS/SAFEA International Partnership Program for Creative Research Teams\\n   of Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Natural Science Foundation of\\n   China [41422601, 41376024, 41376025]\\nFX The CAS/SAFEA International Partnership Program for Creative Research\\n   Teams of Chinese Academy of Sciences; the National Natural Science\\n   Foundation of China under contract Nos 41422601, 41376024 and 41376025.\\nNR 17\\nTC 2\\nZ9 3\\nU1 2\\nU2 15\\nPU SPRINGER\\nPI NEW YORK\\nPA 233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA\\nSN 0253-505X\\nEI 1869-1099\\nJ9 ACTA OCEANOL SIN\\nJI Acta Oceanol.

An important question is whether biogeographic boundaries identified from surface features are important in the deep mesopelagic and bathypelagic. We present community analyses of discrete-depth samples of mesozooplankton and micronekton to full-ocean depth collected in the area where the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is crossed by the Subpolar Front. The results show that the distributional discontinuity associated with the front, which is strong near the surface, decreases with increasing depth. Both the frontal separation near the surface and the community convergence at increasing depths were clearer for mesozooplankton than for micronekton.

The objective is to provide a formula for the meander length scale that can explain observed frontal length scale variability and also be verified with observations. Considering the frontal instability to be a mixture of barotropic and baroclinic instability, the derived along-shelf meander length scale formula is [b(1)/(1 + a(1)S(1/2))]NH/f, where N is the buoyancy frequency; H is the depth of the front; f is the Coriolis parameter; S is the Burger number measuring the ratio of energy conversion associated with barotropic and baroclinic instability; and a(1) and b(1) are empirical constants. Initial growth rate of the frontal instability is formulated as [b(2)(1 + a(1)S(1/2))/(1 + a(2)S(1/2))]NH/L, where is the bottom slope at the foot of the front, and a(2) and b(2) are empirical constants. The formulas are verified using numerical sensitivity simulations, and fitting of the simulated and formulated results gives a(1) = 2.69, b(1) = 14.65, a(2) = 5.1 x 10(3), and b(2) = 6.2 x 10(-2). The numerical simulations also show development of fast-growing frontal symmetric instability when the minimum initial potential vorticity is negative. Although frontal symmetric instability leads to faster development of barotropic and baroclinic instability at later times, it does not significantly influence the meander length scale. The derived meander length scale provides a framework for future studies of the influences of external forces on shelfbreak frontal circulation and cross-frontal exchange.\\nC1 [Zhang, Weifeng G.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Appl Ocean Phys & Engn Dept, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\n   [Gawarkiewicz, Glen G.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Phys Oceanog, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\nRP Zhang, WFG (通讯作者)，Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Appl Ocean Phys & Engn Dept, 266 Woods Hole Rd, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\nEM wzhang@whoi.edu\\nRI Gawarkiewicz, Glen/R-6199-2019\\nFU National Science Foundation [OCE-1129125]; Division Of Ocean Sciences\\n   [1129125] Funding Source: National Science Foundation\\nFX We thank Ken Brink and two anonymous reviewers for the constructive\\n   comments on an earlier version of this paper.

Process measurements taken during the Russian American Long-term Census of the Arctic (RUSALCA) program, such as the carbon isotope composition of sinking particulate organic matter and sediment organic matter, are used to put bacterial production and abundance in context. These measurements show that there are vertical gradients in the water column and that the stable carbon isotope composition of organic materials in the sediments is significantly different from sedimenting materials in the overlying water column. Differences within the water column likely reflect late summer declines in productivity that increase discrimination against C-13 and also provide indications of carbon metabolism in the water column and underlying sediments. Temporal changes in the stable carbon isotope composition of organic matter in surface sediments, as well as C/N ratios in organic matter during the RUSALCA program, are also being observed, specifically higher ratios of C-13/C-12 at some stations near the Chukotka coast, and lower ratios of C-13/C-12 near Point Hope, Alaska. C/N ratios have increased since 2004 at productive sites in the south central Chukchi Sea, suggesting changes in organic material deposition. Other parameters studied on some or all of the decadal series of joint Russia-US cruises include sediment oxygen demand, the nitrogen isotopic composition of organic matter, sediment grain size, chlorophyll content in surface sediments, and elemental ratios of carbon and nitrogen in surface sediments. These process measurements support interpretations that the ecosystem shows strong coupling between bacterial and primary production and the underlying benthos.\\nC1 [Cooper, Lee W.; Grebmeier, Jacqueline M.] Univ Maryland, Chesapeake Biol Lab, Ctr Environm Sci, Solomons, MD 20688 USA.\\n   [Savvichev, Alexander S.] Russian Acad Sci, Winogradsky Inst Microbiol, Moscow, Russia.\\nRP Cooper, LW (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Chesapeake Biol Lab, Ctr Environm Sci, Solomons, MD 20688 USA.\\nEM cooper@umces.edu\\nRI Cooper, Lee W./E-5251-2012; Grebmeier, Jacqueline/L-9805-2013;\\n   Savvichev, Alexander S/B-9245-2018\\nOI Cooper, Lee W./0000-0001-7734-8388; Grebmeier,\\n   Jacqueline/0000-0001-7624-3568; Savvichev, Alexander\\n   S/0000-0002-2459-2990\\nFU US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NA08OAR4310608];\\n   Russian Foundation for Basic Research [RFBR 14-04-01093, RFBR\\n   14-04-00682]\\nFX The authors are grateful to the captain and crew of R/V Professor\\n   Khromov and to Kathy Crane, Terry Whitledge (Chief Scientist), and the\\n   Alliance Group (A.

This mechanism is motivated in part by recent observations of an extremely sharp, density-compensated front at the North Wall of the Gulf Stream. Here, the intergyre, along-isopycnal, salinity-temperature difference is compressed into a span of a few kilometers, making the flow susceptible to cabbeling. The sharpness of the front is caused by frontogenetic strain, which is presumably balanced by submesoscale lateral mixing processes. The balance is studied with the simple model, and a scaling is derived for the amount of water mass transformation resulting from the ensuing cabbeling. The transformation scales with the strain rate, equilibrated width of the front, and the square of the isopycnal temperature contrast across the front. At the major ocean fronts where mode waters are found, this isopycnal temperature contrast decreases with increasing density near the isopycnal layers where mode waters reside. This implies that cabbeling should result in a convergent diapycnal mass flux into mode water density classes. The scaling for the transformation suggests that at these fronts the process could generate 0.01-1 Sverdrups (Sv; 1 Sv equivalent to 10(6) m(3) s(-1)) of mode water. These formation rates, while smaller than mode water formation by air-sea fluxes, should be independent of season and thus could fill select isopycnal layers continuously and play an important role in the dynamics of mode waters on interannual time scales.\\nC1 [Thomas, Leif N.] Stanford Univ, Dept Environm Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.\\n   [Shakespeare, Callum J.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Appl Math & Theoret Phys, Cambridge CB3 9EW, England.\\nRP Thomas, LN (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, 473 Via Ortega, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.\\nEM leift@stanford.edu\\nRI Shakespeare, Callum/L-1839-2015\\nOI Shakespeare, Callum/0000-0002-8109-0751\\nFU Office of Naval Research [N00014-09-1-0202]; Gates Cambridge Scholarship\\nFX This work was supported by the Office of Naval Research Grant\\n   N00014-09-1-0202.

However, there is a dichotomy in approach. Some models use the short-lived Ra-224 (T-1/2=3.7 days) and Ra-223 (T-1/2=11 days) to determine horizontal mixing coefficients and the long-lived Ra-226 (T-1/2= 1600 years) and Ra-228 (T-1/2=5.75 years) to test for the effects of advection. Because the timescales of mixing in most coastal systems (10-80 km offshore) are on the order of months or less, radioactive decay and particle removal of the long-lived isotopes are neglected in these models. If the long-lived isotopes display a linear gradient with distance offshore, this is taken as evidence that conservative mixing rather than advection controls the radium distribution. In this case it is appropriate to neglect the advection term and calculate mixing rates based on the exponential decay of the short-lived isotopes. Other models assume that radioactive decay of all of the isotopes impacts their distribution offshore. These models set up equations that separate the effects of mixing from advection and attempt to force mixing rates derived from all of the Ra isotopes to match. There are several reasons these models are doomed to fail. First, Ra-224 and Ra-223 look at different scales of mixing-there is no reason they must give the same rate. Secondly, on the timescale of coastal mixing decay of Ra-226 and Ra-228 is essentially zero. Equations that include decay terms for Ra-226 and Ra-228 become unrealistic when we consider that the measurement error is considerably greater than decay. In fact particle removal of Ra-226 is more important than radioactive decay. Finally, these models require steady-state conditions on the timescales of the decay terms. In order to use such models, the source functions and distributions of Ra-228 and Ra-226 would have to be constant for several times their half lives, approximately 25 and 4000 years, respectively. Seasonal and annual variability in supply and mixing rearranges the distributions, violating the steady-state assumption. Thus, models utilizing Ra-226 and Ra-228 radioactive decay are useless in the coastal zone. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Satellite data reveal that patterns in sea ice cover have been spatially heterogeneous, with significant declines in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas, yet more complex multi-year variability in the Bering Sea south of St. Lawrence Island. These patterns in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas have intensified since 2000, indicating a regime shift in sea ice cover across the northern portion of the PAR. In particular, satellite data over 1979-2012 reveal localized decreases in sea ice presence of up to -1.64 days/year (Canada Basin) and -1.24 days/year (Beaufort Sea), which accelerated to up to -6.57 days/year (Canada Basin) and -12.84 days/year (Beaufort Sea) over the 2000-2012 time period. In contrast, sea ice in the Bering Sea shows more complex multi-year variability with localized increases in sea ice presence of up to +8.41 days/year since 2000. The observed increases in sea ice cover since 2000 in the southern Bering Sea shelf region are observed in wintertime, whereas sea ice losses in the Canada Basin and Beaufort Sea have occurred during summer. We further compare sea ice variability across the region with the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) wind and air temperature fields to determine the extent to which this recent variability is driven by thermal vs. wind-driven processes. Results suggest that for these localized areas that are experiencing the most rapid shifts in sea ice cover, those in the Beaufort Sea are primarily wind driven, those offshore in the Canada Basin are primarily thermally driven, and those in the Bering Sea are influenced by elements of both. Sea ice variability (and its drivers) across the PAR provides critical insight into the forcing effects of recent shifts in climate and its likely ultimate profound impacts on ecosystem productivity across all trophic levels.

Depth profiles of ocean sediment pore fluid delta O-18 and [Cl-] have been used to reconstruct the delta O-18 and salinity at the LGM. Here, it is investigated whether pore fluid profiles can constrain ocean delta O-18 and salinity at other times and, simultaneously, their ability to constrain the LGM delta O-18 and salinity. An inverse framework is developed that relies on Bayesian parameter estimation, thus allowing formal separation of prior assumptions from the information in observations. Synthetic problems are used to explore the information about past ocean tracers that can be recovered from pore fluid profiles. It is concluded that prior knowledge of deep ocean mixing time scales is essential to an accurate inverse estimate of LGM ocean salinity and delta O-18 from modern pore fluid profiles. The most recent 10 000 years of ocean salinity and delta O-18 and the error in their estimates are better constrained by the pore fluid profiles than are the LGM values. The inverse estimate of salinity and delta O-18 is strongly correlated with the estimate of diffusivity of oxygen isotopes and [Cl-] in sediment pore fluids. Uncertainty on the diffusivity of oxygen isotopes and chloride in sediments is reduced through inversion of the pore fluid profiles, but simultaneous estimation of delta O-18 or salinity and diffusivity increases the total uncertainty. The error reported in previous work may underestimate the true uncertainty of LGM deep ocean salinity and delta O-18.\\nC1 [Miller, Madeline D.; Simons, Mark; Adkins, Jess F.; Minson, Sarah E.] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.\\nRP Miller, MD (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, 20 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.\\nEM madelinemiller@fas.harvard.edu\\nRI Simons, Mark/N-4397-2015\\nOI Simons, Mark/0000-0003-1412-6395; Miller, Madeline/0000-0003-2598-6518\\nNR 70\\nTC 18\\nZ9 18\\nU1 1\\nU2 22\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA\\nSN 0022-3670\\nEI 1520-0485\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

Low silicic acid: nitrate ratios (Si:N) and high nitrate to iron ratios (N: Fe) characteristic of Fe-limiting conditions in the sCCS were associated with the northern cyclone and with the transition zone between the cyclones and the anticyclone. Phytoplankton growth in low-Si:N, high-N:Fe waters responded strongly to added Fe, confirming growth limitation by Fe of the diatom-dominated phytoplankton community. Low Si: N waters had low biogenic silica content, intermediate productivity, but high export compared to intermediate Si: N waters indicating increased export efficiency under Fe stress. Biogenic silica and particulate organic carbon (POC) export were both high beneath low Si: N waters with biogenic silica export being especially enhanced. This suggests that relatively high POC export from low Si: N waters was supported by silica ballasting from Fe-limited diatoms. Higher POC export efficiency in low Si: N waters may have been further enhanced by lower rates of organic carbon remineralization due to reduced grazing of more heavily armored diatoms growing under Fe stress. The results imply that Fe stress can enhance carbon export, despite lowering productivity, by driving higher export efficiency.\\nC1 [Brzezinski, Mark A.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.\\n   [Krause, Jeffrey W.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.\\n   [Krause, Jeffrey W.] Dauphin Isl Sea Lab, Dauphin Isl, AL USA.\\n   [Bundy, Randelle M.; Barbeau, Katherine A.; Franks, Peter; Goericke, Ralf] Univ S Alabama, Dept Marine Sci, Mobile, AL 36688 USA.\\n   [Landry, Michael R.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Integrat Oceanog Div, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.\\n   [Stukel, Michael R.] Florida State Univ, Dept Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.\\nRP Brzezinski, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.\\nEM mark.brzezinski@lifesci.ucsb.edu\\nRI Bundy, Randelle M/J-8453-2016\\nOI Bundy, Randelle M/0000-0002-0600-3953; Barbeau,\\n   Katherine/0000-0002-2132-7219; Stukel, Michael/0000-0002-7696-6739\\nFU California Current Ecosystem Long Term Ecological Research program under\\n   award OCE [OCE 1026607]; Santa Barbara Coastal Long Term Ecological\\n   Research program [9982105, 0620276]; National Science Foundation;\\n   Division Of Ocean Sciences [1026607] Funding Source: National Science\\n   Foundation\\nFX The primary data for this paper are available through CCE LTER data\\n   archive at http://oceaninformatics.ucsd.edu/datazoo/; altimeter products\\n   were distributed by Aviso (http://www.aviso.oceanobs.com).

The gravity current splits at the density step, and the portion of the buoyancy flux becoming an interflow is largely controlled by the vertical distribution of velocity and density within the gravity current and the magnitude of the density step between the two ambient layers. This is in agreement with recent laboratory observations. The strongest changes in the ambient density profiles occur as a result of the impingement of supercritical currents with strong density contrasts, for which a large portion of the gravity current detaches from the bottom and becomes an interflow. We characterize the current partition process in the simulated experiments using the densimetric Froude number of the current (Fr) across the density step (upstream and downstream). When underflows are formed, more supercritical currents are observed downstream of the density step compared to upstream (Fr-u < Fr-d), and thus, stronger mixing of the current with the ambient water downstream. However, when split flows and interflows are formed, smaller Fr values are identified after the current crosses the density step (Fr-u > Fr-d), which indicates lower mixing between the current and ambient water after the impingement due to the significant stripping of interfacial material at the density step.\\nC1 [Cortes, A.; Rueda, F.

The sonar surveys included swath and single-beam bathymetry, sidescan, and chirp subbottom data collection. The geophysical data were groundtruthed using vibracore sediment collection. The results provide insight into the evolution of the inner shelf and the relationship between the near surface geologic framework and the morphology of the coastal zone. This study focuses on the buried Pleistocene fluvial deposits and late Holocene shore-oblique sand ridges offshore of Petit Bois Island and Petit Bois Pass. Prior to this study, the physical characteristics, evolution, and interrelationship of the ridges between both the shelf geology and the adjacent barrier island platform had not been evaluated. Numerous studies elsewhere along the coastal margin attribute shoal origin and sand-ridge evolution to hydrodynamic processes in shallow water ( < 20 m). Here we characterize the correlation between the geologic framework and surface morphology and demonstrate that the underlying stratigraphy must also be considered when developing an evolutionary conceptual model. It is important to understand this near surface, nearshore dynamic in order to understand how the stratigraphy influences the long-term response of the coastal zone to sea-level rise. The study also contributes to a growing body of work characterizing shore-oblique sand ridges which, along with the related geology, are recognized as increasingly important components to a nearshore framework whose origins and evolution must be understood and inventoried to effectively manage the coastal zone.

The current study greatly expands this record with 527 delta O-18 values from 47 stations located throughout the mid- to low-latitude NE Atlantic. In addition, 60 was analyzed in the 192 samples collected along the GEOTRACES North Atlantic Transect GA03 (GA03_e=KN199-4) and the 115 Iberia-Forams cruise samples from the western and southern Iberian margin. An intercomparison study between the two stable isotope measurement techniques (cavity ring-down laser spectroscopy and magnetic-sector isotope ratio mass spectrometry) used to analyze GA03_e samples reveals relatively good agreement for both hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios. The surface (0-100 m) and central (100-500 m) water isotope data show the typical, evaporation related trend of increasing values equatorward with the exception for the zonal transect off Cape Blanc, NVV Africa. Off Cape Blanc, surface water isotope signatures are modified by the upwelling of fresher Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) that generally has isotopic values of 0.0 to 0.5%o for delta O-18 and 0 to 2%0 for delta D. Along the Iberian margin the Mediterranean Outflow Water (MOW) is clearly distinguished by its high 6180 (0.5-1.1%o) and delta D (3-6%0) values that can be traced into the open Atlantic. Isotopic values in the NE Atlantic Deep Water (NEADW) are relatively low (8180: 0.1 to 0.5%0; delta D: 1 to 4%0) and show a broader range than observed previously in the northern and southern convection areas. The NEADW is best observed at GA03_e Stations 5 and 7 in the central NE Atlantic basin. Antarctic Bottom Water isotope values are relatively high indicating modification of the original Antarctic source water along the flow path. The reconstructed delta O-18-salinity relationship for the complete data set has a slope of 0.51, i.e., slightly steeper than the 0.46 described previously by Pierre et al. (1994, J. Mar. Syst 5 (2), 159-170.) for the tropical to subtropical Northeast Atlantic. This slope decreases to 0.46 for the subtropical North Atlantic Central Water (NACW) and the MOW and to 032 for the surface waters of the upper 50 m. The delta D-salinity mixing lines have estimated slopes of 3.01 for the complete data, 1.26 for the MOW, 3.47 for the NACW, and 2.63 for the surface waters. The slopes of the 6180-8D relationship are significantly lower than the one for the Global Meteoric Water Line with 5.6 for the complete data set, 2.30 for the MOW, 4.79 for the NACW, and 3.99 for the surface waters.

Results show limited nutrient-like distribution of As5+, and upper ocean maxima in As3+ and methylated As as found in many other studies In the oligotrophic water masses, microbial communities, i.e. phytoplankton, appear to favor the reduction to As instead of methylation as detoxification of As5+ taken up during phosphorus (P) limitation due to their chemical similarities. The depth-integrated average concentrations in the mixed layer depth of As3+ in the western and eastern Atlantic Ocean were 130 + 1.14 nmol L-1 (n=4) and 0.65 (n=2), respectively, and rose to 3.30 nmol L-1 (n=2) in the Central Atlantic Ocean. No pattern was observed for Ass (15.7 + 2.8 nmol L-1, n=8) and methylated species were detected occasionally below 0.41 nmol L-1 in the mixed layer. Based on significant correlations between phosphate, alkaline phosphate activity (APA), a conventional proxy for P limitation, and As3+, we conclude that As3+ is a good proxy for P limitation within the upper water column similar to our earlier evaluation of surface data. Mass balances for the mixed layer show that atmospheric inputs of Ass+ can compensate for the losses via export fluxes and microbial reduction to As3+. The cycling of As3+ is more complex, with sources from Ass+ reduction and losses due to photochemical and microbial-induced oxidation. The resulting residence time of As3+ with respect to these processes can be as short as 0.7-3 days. Unlike As5+, atmospheric inputs of As3+ cannot balance the oxidative losses and the short residence time further limits horizontal and vertical advective/diffusive inputs. It appears that reduction of Ass coupled with detoxification and general microbial reduction are the sources of As3+ in the oceanic mixed layer. While As3+ production during As5+ detoxification has been well studied, the generic microbial reduction of Ass to As3+ requires a more thorough investigation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Using the recently developed incremental strong constraint 4D Variational data assimilation algorithm, the model assimilates satellite sea surface temperature and in situ temperature and salinity profiles measured by expendable bathythermograph, Argo floats, and shipboard CTD casts. Validation against independent observations shows that the model skill is significantly improved after data assimilation. The data-assimilative model hindcast reproduces the temporal and spatial evolution of the ocean state, showing that a sea level depression southwest of the Scotian Shelf played a critical role in shaping the gulf-wide circulation. Heat budget analysis further demonstrates that both advection and surface heat flux contribute to temperature variability. The estimated time scale for coastal water to travel from the Scotian Shelf to the Jordan Basin is around 60 days, which is consistent with previous estimates based on in situ observations. Our study highlights the importance of resolving upstream and offshore forcing conditions in predicting the coastal circulation in the GOM.\\nC1 [Li, Yizhen; He, Ruoying] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Marine Earth & Atmospher Sci, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.\\n   [Li, Yizhen; McGillicuddy, Dennis J.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Appl Ocean Phys & Engn, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\n   [Chen, Ke] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Phys Oceanog, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\nRP He, RY (通讯作者)，N Carolina State Univ, Dept Marine Earth & Atmospher Sci, Box 8208, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.\\nEM rhe@ncsu.edu\\nRI Li, Yizhen/O-3869-2015; He, Ruoying/C-5598-2015\\nOI Li, Yizhen/0000-0001-6565-1339; McGillicuddy,\\n   Dennis/0000-0002-1437-2425; He, Ruoying/0000-0001-6158-2292\\nFU National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) [NA06NOS4780245];\\n   NOAA [NA11NOS4780023]; Postdoctoral Scholar Program at the Woods Hole\\n   Oceanographic Institution; George D.

The compressible and nonlinear character of the equation of state for seawater has been thought to cause the reference state to be ill defined, casting doubt on the usefulness of APE theory for investigating ocean energetics under realistic conditions. Using a method based on the volume frequency distribution of parcels as a function of temperature and salinity in the context of the seawater Boussinesq approximation, which is illustrated using climatological data, the authors show that compressibility effects are in fact minor. The reference state can be regarded as a well-defined one-dimensional function of depth, which forms a surface in temperature, salinity, and density space between the surface and the bottom of the ocean. For a very small proportion of water masses, this surface can be multivalued and water parcels can have up to two statically stable levels in the reference density profile, of which the shallowest is energetically more accessible. Classifying parcels from the surface to the bottom gives a different reference density profile than classifying in the opposite direction. However, this difference is negligible. This study shows that the reference state obtained by standard sorting methods is equivalent to, though computationally more expensive than, the volume frequency distribution approach. The approach that is presented can be applied systematically and in a computationally efficient manner to investigate the APE budget of the ocean circulation using models or climatological data.\\nC1 [Saenz, Juan A.; Hughes, Graham O.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Canberra, ACT, Australia.\\n   [Tailleux, Remi] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading, Berks, England.\\n   [Butler, Edward D.; Oliver, Kevin I.

In this contribution, we document similar findings over a 1-month period in Fall 2012 and investigate physical processes leading to vertical convergence of particles to the observed layers, both from resuspended sediment originating below the layer depth and from phytoplankton originating above the layer depth. Physical and optical vertical structure was measured by an autonomous vertical profiler, thermistor chain, and acoustic Doppler current profiler, and optical sensors fixed to a bottom-mounted frame measured beam attenuation and particle size distribution within the benthic boundary layer (BBL). These data support a conceptual model for layer formation in which (1) bottom material was mobilized into the BBL by semidiurnal internal tidal currents; (2) brief updraft events regularly injected particles into the interior water column during the downslope phase of the semidiurnal internal tide; and (3) particles converged at the detached layer due to a measured, but previously unreported, long time scale mean vertical convergence in flow. Subduction and vertical mixing of phytoplankton to the subeuphotic layer were also observed and are presented in two case studies in connection with horizontal convergences of surface water masses.\\nC1 [Sevadjian, Jeff C.; Raanan, Ben Y.] Monterey Bay Aquarium Res Inst, Monterey, CA 95039 USA.\\n   [McPhee-Shaw, Erika E.] Western Washington Univ, Shannon Point Marine Ctr, Anacortes, WA USA.\\n   [Cheriton, Olivia M.; Storlazzi, Curt D.] US Geol Survey, Pacific Coastal & Marine Sci Ctr, Santa Cruz, CA USA.\\nRP Sevadjian, JC (通讯作者)，Monterey Bay Aquarium Res Inst, Monterey, CA 95039 USA.\\nEM jsevadjian@mbari.org\\nOI Cheriton, Olivia/0000-0003-3011-9136\\nFU National Science Foundation [OCE0961810]; U.S. Geological Survey\\nFX Data for this project are archived and published with the National\\n   Oceanographic Data Center at http://accession.nodc.noaa.gov/123606.

A wide range of data sets have shown that environmental conditions, such as temperature and marine productivity, affect the distribution and biological processes of these species, and thus the activities of the humans that depend on them. In this special issue, 25 papers arising from the 2nd CLIOTOP symposium, held in Noumea, New Caledonia in February 2013 report the importance of realistic physical descriptions of oceanic processes for climate change projections, demonstrate a wide range of predator responses to historical climate variability, describe new analytical approaches for understanding the physiology, behaviour and trophodynamics, and project future distributions for a range of species. Several contributions discuss the implications for conservation and fisheries and show that resolving ecosystem management challenges and conflicts in the face of climate change is possible, but will require attention by decision-makers to issues that are broader than their traditional mandate. In the coming years, an increased focus on the development of management options to reduce the impacts of climate change on top predators and their dependent industries is needed.

A number of conflicts and trade-offs exist in the harvesting of pelagic species, including (i) maximizing future food production given the depleted state of some stocks; (ii) minimizing bycatch of non-target species, (iii) setting ecosystem allocation rules for non-target top predators, such as seabirds, and (iv) maximizing value and livelihoods for local economies. Climate change can be expected to exacerbate some of these conflicts as the ranges of species and their habitats change over varying geographic, depth and temporal scales. Understanding the distribution of these impacts can be difficult due to the scarcity of observational data on species and ecosystems. Resolving all these conflicts is achievable with current approaches and technologies. Nevertheless, managing fishery production systems to provide fish for food security and conserving biodiversity will be particularly challenging. The complexity added by climate change can be managed with greater use of early warning systems and precautionary management Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The discharge rapidly increases and decreases over a 30-day period and has a maximum of 6000 m(3)s(-1). This study examined the response to a landfast ice cover of 26-km width and one that encompasses the entire shelf width. The model setting mimics spring conditions on the Alaskan Beaufort Sea (ABS) shelf. In comparison with the ice-free case subject to the same discharge scenario, underice plumes are broader and deeper, and the downwave freshwater flux is substantially decreased and delayed. Multiple anticyclonic bulges form in the ice-free case, but only a single, large bulge forms when ice is present. These differences are because of the frictional coupling between the ice and plume, which results in an Ekman-like underice boundary layer, a subsurface velocity maximum, and frictional shears that enhance vertical mixing and entrainment. For a partially ice-covered shelf, the plume spreads across the ice edge to form a swift, buoyant, ice-edge jet, whose width accords with the scale of Yankovsky and Chapman for a surface-advected plume. For a fully ice-covered shelf, the buoyant water spreads 60km offshore over a 30-day period. For a steady discharge of 6000m(3)s(-1) and a completely ice-covered shelf, the plume spreads offshore at a rate of similar to 1.5km day(-1) and extends similar to 95km offshore after 60 days.\\nC1 [Kasper, Jeremy L.; Weingartner, Thomas J.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Inst Marine Sci, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.\\nRP Kasper, JL (通讯作者)，Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Inst Northern Engn, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.\\nEM jlkasper@alaska.edu\\nOI Kasper, Jeremy/0000-0003-0975-6114\\nFU Prince William Sound Oil Spill Recovery Institute (OSRI); Alaska Sea\\n   Grant; Center for Global Change; UAF Graduate School; U.S. BOEMRE\\n   through the University of Alaska Coastal Marine Institute\\n   [1435-01-02-CA-85294]; Office of Naval Research through the National\\n   Oceanographic Partnership Program [N00014-07-1-1040]\\nFX K.

These were clearest in a layer extending from approximate to 300 to 600 m depth and had periods near 3 weeks. Phase propagation was upward. Measurements from two sequential time series at the equator, four meridional transects and one zonal transect are used to identify the oscillation as a Yanai wave packet and to establish its dominant frequency and vertical wavelength. The Doppler shift is accounted for, so that measured wave properties are translated into the reference frame of the mean zonal flow. We take advantage of the fact that, in the depth range where the wave signal was clearest, the time-averaged current and buoyancy frequency were nearly uniform with depth, allowing application of the classical theoretical representation of vertically propagating plane waves. Using the theory, we estimate wave properties that are not directly measured, such as the group velocity and the zonal wavelength and phase speed. The theory predicts a vertical energy flux that is comparable to that carried by midlatitude near-inertial waves. We also quantify the wave-driven meridional heat flux and the Stokes drift.\\nC1 [Smyth, W. D.; Durland, T. S.; Moum, J.

The ocean diurnal cycle exhibits pronounced seasonality that is linked to seasonal variations in the surface wind field. In boreal summer and fall, steady trade winds and clear skies dominate, with limited diurnal variability in sea surface temperature. Diurnal shear layers, with reduced Richardson numbers, are regularly observed descending into the marginally unstable equatorial undercurrent below the mixed layer, conditions favorable for the generation of deep-cycle turbulence. In contrast, in boreal winter and spring, winds are lighter and more variable, mixed layers are shallow, and diurnal variability of sea surface temperature is large. During these conditions, diurnal shear layers are less prominent, and the stability of the undercurrent increases, suggesting seasonal covariance between diurnal near-surface shear and deep-cycle turbulence. Modulation of the ocean diurnal cycle by tropical instability waves is also identified. This work provides the first observational assessment of the diurnal cycle of near-surface shear, stratification, and marginal instability in the equatorial Atlantic, confirming previous modeling results and offering a complementary perspective on similar work in the equatorial Pacific.\\nC1 [Wenegrat, Jacob O.; McPhaden, Michael J.] Univ Washington, Sch Oceanog, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.\\n   [McPhaden, Michael J.] NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.\\nRP Wenegrat, JO (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Sch Oceanog, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.\\nEM wenegrat@uw.edu\\nRI McPhaden, Michael J/D-9799-2016\\nOI McPhaden, Michael J/0000-0002-8423-5805\\nFU Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean (JISAO) under\\n   NOAA [NA10OAR4320148]; JISAO [2402]; PMEL [4244]\\nFX The authors would like to thank Eric Kunze and Ren-Chieh Lien for\\n   helpful discussions of this work, as well as Bill Smyth and an anonymous\\n   reviewer for their comments.

Previous field and laboratory studies have demonstrated significant apparent variability in a(ph)(Chl)(*) () for natural samples and algal cultures. However, the potential impact of measurement uncertainties on derived values of a(ph)(Chl)(*) () has received insufficient study. This study presents an analysis of measurement uncertainties for a data set collected in the Ligurian Sea in Spring and assesses the impact on estimates of a(ph)(Chl)(*) (). It is found that a large proportion of apparent variability in this set of a(ph)(Chl)(*) () can be attributed to measurement errors. Application of the same analysis to the global NOMAD data set suggests that a significant fraction of variability in a(ph)(Chl)(*) () may also be due to measurement errors.\\nC1 [McKee, David; Neil, Claire; Cunningham, Alex] Univ Strathclyde, Dept Phys, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.\\n   [Roettgers, Ruediger] Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Inst Coastal Res, Dept Remote Sensing, Geesthacht, Germany.\\n   [Neukermans, Griet] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Marine Phys Lab, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.\\n   [Calzado, Violeta Sanjuan; Trees, Charles; Ampolo-Rella, Marina] Ctr Maritime Res & Expt, Res Dept, La Spezia, Italy.\\nRP McKee, D (通讯作者)，Univ Strathclyde, Dept Phys, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.\\nEM david.mckee@strath.ac.uk\\nRI Neukermans, Griet/S-6313-2017\\nOI Neukermans, Griet/0000-0002-8258-3590; McKee, David/0000-0001-8023-5923;\\n   Sanjuan Calzado, Violeta/0000-0002-8023-1903\\nFU NERC [NE/E013678/1]; NERC [NE/H021493/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural\\n   Environment Research Council [NE/E013678/1, NE/H021493/1] Funding\\n   Source: researchfish\\nFX The authors thank Kevin Ruddick (MUMM) for providing access to HPLC\\n   data.

These signatures represent changes in ventilation mediated by mixing and entrainment processes that may be location-specific. Here we use available data to document, as best possible, those mixing processes as Weddell Sea Deep and Bottom Waters flow along the South Orkney Plateau, exit the Weddell Sea via Orkney Passage and fill the abyssal Scotia Sea. First, we find that an abrupt transition in topography upstream of Orkney Passage delimits the extent of the coldest waters along the Plateau\\'s flanks and may indicate a region of especially intense mixing. Second, we revisit a control volume budget by Heywood et al. (2002) for waters trapped within the Scotia Sea after entering through Orkney Passage. This budget requires extremely vigorous water mass transformations with a diapycnal transfer coefficient of 39(10)x10-4 m(2) s(-1). Evidence for such intense diapycnal mixing is not found in the abyssal Scotia Sea interior and, while we do find large rates of diapycnal mixing in conjunction with a downwelling Ekman layer on the western side of Orkney Passage, it is insufficient to close the budget. This leads us to hypothesize that the Heywood budget is closed by a boundary mixing process in which the Ekman layer associated with the Weddell Sea Deep Water boundary current experiences relatively large vertical scale overturning associated with tidal forcing along the southern boundary of the Scotia Sea.\\nC1 [Polzin, K.

Previous studies from the southeastern Bering Sea shelf documented substantial differences in zooplankton taxa in the Middle and Inner Shelf Domains between warm and cold years. Our investigation expands this analysis into the northern Bering Sea and the south Outer Domain, looking at zooplankton community structure during a period of climate-mediated, large-scale change. Elevated air temperatures in the early 2000s resulted in regional warming and low sea-ice extent in the southern shelf whereas the late 2000s were characterized by cold winters, extensive spring sea ice, and a well-developed pool of cold water over the entire Middle Domain. The abundance of large zooplankton taxa such as Calanus spp. (C. marshallae and C. glacialis), and Parasagitta elegans, increased from warm to cold periods, while the abundance of gelatinous zooplankton (Cnidaria) and small taxa decreased. Biomass followed the same trends as abundance, except that the biomass of small taxa in the southeastern Bering Sea remained constant due to changes in abundance of small copepod taxa (increases in Acartia spp. and Pseudocalanus spp. and decreases in Oithona spp.). Statistically significant changes in zooplankton community structure and individual species were greatest in the Middle Domain, but were evident in all shelf domains, and in both the northern and southern portions of the eastern shelf. Changes in community structure did not occur abruptly during the transition from warm to cold, but seemed to begin gradually and build as the influence of the sea ice and cold water temperatures persisted. The change occurred one year earlier in the northern than the southern Middle Shelf. These and previous observations demonstrate that lower trophic levels within the eastern Bering Sea respond to climate-mediated changes on a variety of time scales, including those shorter than the commonly accepted quasi-decadal time periods. This lack of resilience or inertia at the lowest trophic levels affects production at higher trophic levels and must be considered in management strategy evaluations of living marine resources.

Since fronts are associated with convergent currents and productive fishing grounds, any possible convergence of pollutants at fronts would raise concerns. The focus here is on relatively persistent organic pollutants. POPs, as non-persistent organic pollutants are rarely found in the open ocean. Results from recent cruises in the Atlantic Ocean are examined for POP distributions across ocean fronts in (i) the Canary Current; (ii) the Gulf Stream; and (iii) the Amazon and Rio de la Plata Plumes. Few studies achieved a spatial resolution of 10-20 km, while most had 100-300 km between adjacent stations. The majority of the well-resolved studies measured perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), which seem particularly well suited for frontal resolution. In the NE Atlantic, concentrations of PFCs sharply decreased between SW Europe and NW Africa upon crossing the Canary Current Front at 24-27 degrees N. In the Western Atlantic, the PFC concentrations sharply increased upon entering the Amazon River Plume and Rio de la Plata Plume. In the NW Atlantic, concentrations of several pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are very high in Rhode Island Sound, decreasing to below detection limit in the open ocean. The more persistent and already phased-out polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) displayed elevated concentrations in the Gulf Stream and Rhode Island Sound, thereby highlighting the importance of ocean fronts, along-front currents, and cross-frontal transport for the dispersal of PCBs.

By linking to Argo subsurface salinity observations and satellite-derived surface forcing datasets, the study discovered that the SSS front is not a stand-alone feature; it is in fact the surface manifestation of a low-salinity convergence zone (LSCZ) located within 100 m of the upper ocean. The near-surface salinity budget analysis suggested that, although the LSCZ is sourced from the rainfall in the Inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ), its generation and maintenance are governed by the wind-driven Ekman dynamics, not the surface evaporation-minus-precipitation flux. Three distinct features highlight the relationship between the oceanic LSCZ and the atmospheric ITCZ. First, the seasonal movement of the LSCZ is characterized by a monotonic northward displacement starting from the near-equatorial latitudes in boreal spring, unlike the ITCZ that is known for its seasonal north-south displacement. Second, the lowest SSS waters in the LSCZ are locked to the northern edge of the Ekman salt convergence throughout the year, but have no fixed relationship with the ITCZ rain band. Collocation between the LSCZ and ITCZ occurs only during August-October, the time that the ITCZ rain band coincides with the Ekman convergence zone. Lastly, the SSS front couples with the Ekman convergence zone but not the ITCZ. The evidence reinforces the findings of the study that the Ekman processes are the leading mechanism of the oceanic LSCZ and the SSS front is the surface manifestation of the LSCZ.\\nC1 Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Phys Oceanog, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\nRP Yu, LS (通讯作者)，Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Phys Oceanog, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\nEM lyu@whoi.edu\\nFU NASA Ocean Salinity Science Team (OSST) [NNX12AG93G]; NOAA Office of\\n   Climate Observation (OCO) [NA09OAR4320129]; NASA Ocean Vector Wind\\n   Science Team (OVWST) [NNA10AO86G]\\nFX The study was supported by the NASA Ocean Salinity Science Team (OSST)\\n   under grant NNX12AG93G.

The surface buoyancy gradients and ageostrophic secondary circulations intensify in response to the mesoscale strain field as predicted by the theory of filamentogenesis. It can be understood in terms of a dual frontogenetic process, along the lines understood for a single front. There is, however, a stronger secondary circulation due to the amplification at the center of a cold filament. Filament dynamics in the presence of a mixed layer are not adequately described by the classical thermal wind balance. The effect of vertical mixing of momentum due to turbulence in the surface layer is of the same order of magnitude as the pressure gradient and Coriolis force and contributes equally to a so-called turbulent thermal wind balance. Filamentogenesis is disrupted by vigorous submesoscale instabilities. The cause of the instability is the lateral shear as energy production by the horizontal Reynolds stress is the primary fluctuation source during the process; this contrasts with the usual baroclinic instability of submesoscale surface fronts. The filaments are lines of strong oceanic surface convergence as illustrated by the release of Lagrangian parcels in the Gulf Stream. Diabatic mixing is strong as parcels move across the filaments and downwell into the pycnocline. The life cycle of a filament is typically a few days in duration, from intensification to quasi stationarity to instability to dissipation.\\nC1 [Gula, Jonathan; Molemaker, M.

Wind stress curl anomaly (WSCA) in the region of 10 degrees N-15 degrees N and 160 degrees E-170 degrees E generates Rossby waves and affects the NEC bifurcation along the Philippine coast. From 1976 to 1992, following a regime shift to the positive Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) phase, PDO and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) match each other in strength and have a neutralized effect on the WSCA. From 1993 to 2009, WSCA matches PDO well, and its correlation with ENSO is lower. Using a linear regression model, we show that the influence of PDO has nearly 13 times weight over that of ENSO. Prior to the 1976 regime shift, WSCA is closely related to ENSO from 1961 to 1975, and it does not correlate significantly with PDO. Our analysis results show that Rossby waves are preferentially generated in either the negative PDO phase when the ENSO signal dominates, or in the positive PDO phase when the ENSO signal is overshadowed. In the phase when the positive PDO counteracts with the ENSO signal, neither ENSO nor PDO has a significant influence on Rossby wave generations through the WSCA.\\nC1 [Wang, Li-Chiao; Wu, Chau-Ron] Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.\\n   [Qiu, Bo] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Oceanog, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.\\nRP Wu, CR (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.\\nEM cwu@ntnu.edu.tw\\nRI Wu, Chau-Ron/GDZ-5620-2022; Qiu, Bo/D-9569-2017\\nFU Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, ROC [MOST\\n   101-2611-M-003-002-MY3]\\nFX The authors would like to thank the Editor, Dr. Chunzai Wang, and the\\n   anonymous reviewers for their detailed suggestions to improve the\\n   manuscript.

Using a high-resolution ocean general circulation model, we investigate the effect of these two EOFs on changes in warm water volume (WWV), interhemispheric mass transports, and Indonesian Throughflow (ITF). Wind stress anomalies associated with the first EOF produce changes in WWV that are dynamically consistent with the conceptual recharge oscillator paradigm. The ITF is found to heavily damp these WWV changes, reducing their variance by half. Wind stress anomalies associated with the second EOF, which depicts the southward wind shift, are responsible for WWV changes that are of comparable magnitude to those driven by the first mode. The southward wind shift is also responsible for the majority of the observed interhemispheric upper ocean mass exchanges. These winds transfer mass between the Northern and the Southern Hemisphere during El Nino events. Whilst water is transferred in the opposite direction during La Nina events, the magnitude of this exchange is roughly half of that seen during El Nino events. Thus, the discharging of WWV during El Nino events is meridionally asymmetric, while the WWV recharging during a La Nina event is largely symmetric. The inclusion of the southward wind shift is also shown to allow ENSO to exchange mass with much higher latitudes than that allowed by the first EOF alone.\\nC1 [McGregor, Shayne; Spence, Paul; England, Matthew H.; Santoso, Agus] Univ New S Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW, Australia.\\n   [McGregor, Shayne; Spence, Paul; England, Matthew H.; Santoso, Agus] Univ New S Wales, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Syst Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia.\\n   [Schwarzkopf, Franziska U.; Boening, Claus W.] GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res, Kiel, Germany.\\n   [Kessler, William S.] NOAA PMEL, Seattle, WA USA.\\n   [Timmermann, Axel] Univ Hawaii, Int Pacific Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.\\n   [Timmermann, Axel] Univ Hawaii, Dept Oceanog, SOEST, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.\\nRP McGregor, S (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW, Australia.\\nEM shayne.mcgregor@unsw.edu.au\\nRI Santoso, Agus/J-7350-2012; Schwarzkopf, Franziska/P-7621-2019; England,\\n   Matthew H/A-7539-2011; Santoso, Agus/P-1918-2019; Timmermann,\\n   Axel/F-4977-2011; Boening, Claus W/B-1686-2012; Boening,\\n   Claus/AAW-6387-2020; Timmermann, Axel/Y-2799-2019\\nOI Santoso, Agus/0000-0001-7749-8124; Schwarzkopf,\\n   Franziska/0000-0002-2747-8456; England, Matthew H/0000-0001-9696-2930;\\n   Santoso, Agus/0000-0001-7749-8124; Timmermann, Axel/0000-0003-0657-2969;\\n   Boening, Claus W/0000-0002-6251-5777; Boening,\\n   Claus/0000-0002-6251-5777; Timmermann, Axel/0000-0003-0657-2969; Spence,\\n   Paul/0000-0001-5156-2204; McGregor, Shayne/0000-0003-3222-7042\\nFU Australian Research Council (ARC) including the ARC Centre of Excellence\\n   in Climate System Science\\nFX The TROPAC01 experiment output analyzed in this paper, which exceeds 3TB\\n   when compressed, is stored at the University of New South Wales\\n   long-term data store.

Modified from atmospheric research, the non-invasive eddy correlation technique can be used to characterize benthic boundary layer dynamics and measure O-2 flux across the sediment-water interface without excluding the natural hydrodynamic flow. In 2009, eddy correlation measurements were made in 5 discrete months with varying conditions at a 30 m site off Yaquina Head, Newport, OR. The O-2 flux was found to be primarily into the bed (-18 +/- 3 mmol m(-2) d(-1); mean +/- SE, n=137 15-min bursts) but was sensitive to non-steady state changes in O-2 concentrations caused by the differential advection of water masses with variable mean O-2 concentrations. Important contributions to O-2 eddy fluxes at surface wave frequencies were seen in eddy correlation cospectra and these are interpreted as being indicative of consumption enhanced by advective transport of O-2 into the bed. The sediments were deposits of fine sand with permeabilities of 1.3-4.7 x 10(-11) m(2) and wave-generated ripples. Sediment pigment and organic carbon concentrations were low (chlorophyll-alpha: 0.02-0.45 mu g g(-1), phaeophytin-alpha: 0.38-1.38 mu g g(-1) and organic carbon: 0.05-0.39% dry wt in discrete depth intervals from cores collected between March and October), but it was evident that during the summer fresh pigments were trapped in the sand and rapidly mixed over the uppermost 0-13 cm. From these results it is inferred that physical forcing associated largely with waves and currents may accentuate the role of sediment-covered inner shelf habitats as a regional O-2 sink compared to the middle shelf. In effect, the action of waves and currents in the benthic boundary layer enables aerobic respiration that counterbalances the oxygenation of the water column by primary production and mixing in the surface layer.

For this study, we estimate PNP by employing a one-dimensional analytical model using in situ and model data for the waters off the western Antarctica Peninsula (WAP) for midsummer, centered around January. Field observations were made during the Palmer Long Term Ecological Research (Palmer LTER) program. A decade long timeseries of NO3 vertical profile data (1998-2007. N=516) was used for PNP computations.\\n   PNP was calculated for the WAP region by subdividing it into three sub-regions i.e. Coastal, Shelf and Slope based on bathymetry and water mass properties. The Coastal sub-region includes waters with bathymetric depths of 450 m or less with Slope water accounting for the oceanic region greater than 750 m water depth, while the extensive Shelf region occupies the area between these depth limits. Mean PNP estimates were computed to be 2482.6 + 197.5, 384.5 + 61.7, and 891.1 + 81.8 mg C m(-2) d(-1) for the Coastal, Shelf and Slope sub-regions, respectively. The estimated overall mean PNP rate for the entire Palmer LTER WAP region during midsummer (January) was 1257.5 + 113.6 mg C m(-2) d(-1). The mean potential f-ratio (PNP:PP) for the WAP region was closer to unity (potential f-ratio =1.2) indicating that nPP (as opposed to recycled production) plays a major role in sustaining this sporadic but highly productive Antarctic ecosystem during mid-summer. We have also analyzed a longer time series from oceanic sampling stations off Palmer Station, Anvers Island. Antarctica spanning yeardays 310-45 (late November-mid February, 1994-2007). Harmonic regression fit of PNP data from all stations within this nearshore sampling grid of the Palmer LTER Program during the growth season provides maximum and minimum PNP rates of 2181.78 and 14.69 mg C m(-2) d(-1) on yeardays 335 (late November) and 43 (mid February), respectively. The overall mean PNP for this region was estimated to be 1040.93 + 764.58 mg C m(-2) d(-1) by employing a constant Kz value of 10(-5) m s(-2). The maximum and minimum PNP values coincide approximately with the onset and demise of annual algal bloom.\\n   Analysis of the terms used in the PNP equation indicate that both NO3 drawdown rates (mean=13.25 + 9.57 mmol m(-2) d N=156) and NO3 flux into the euphotic layer (mean=1.36 1.79 mmol m(-2) d(-1), N=156) have high temporal and spatial variability. NO3 drawdown rates were higher than NO3 flux into the control volume by approximately an order of magnitude. Sensitivity analyses of the model using two extreme values of Kz, (10-4 and 10(-5) m s(-2)) that are widely reported in the literature for the WAP region, yielded a PNP range of 97.13 mg C m(-2) d(-1). The latter accounted for approximately 10% of the overall computed PNP.

We use a sequence of simple analytical models to show that due to the nonlinearity of the system, the simplified heat flux from the modeled AMOC to the atmosphere above is so robust that even changes of as much as 50% in the present AMOC transport are not enough to significantly change the temperature of the outgoing warmed atmosphere (i.e., the fraction of the atmosphere warmed by the AMOC). Our most realistic model (which is still a far cry from reality) involves a warm ocean losing heat to an otherwise motionless and colder atmosphere. As a result, the compressible atmosphere convects, and the generated airflow ultimately penetrates horizontally into the surrounding air. The behavior of the system is attributable to four key aspects of the underlying physical processes: (1) convective atmospheric transport increases by warming the atmosphere, (2) the ocean is warmer than the atmosphere, (3) the surface heat flux is usually proportional to the temperature difference between the ocean and the atmosphere, and (4) the specific heat capacity of water is much larger than that of the air. Taken together, these properties of the system lead to the existence of a dynamic \"asymptotic\" state, a modeled regime, in which even significant changes in the AMOC transport have almost no effect on the ocean-atmosphere heat flux and the resulting outgoing atmospheric temperature. In the hypothetical limit of an infinitely large specific heat capacity of water, C-pw there is no change in either the atmospheric transport or the temperatures of the ocean and the atmosphere, regardless of how large the reduction in the AMOC transport is. Although our models may be too simple to allow for a direct application to the ocean and atmosphere, they do shed light on the processes in question.\\nC1 [Behl, M.; Nof, D.; Van Gorder, S.] Florida State Univ, Dept Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.\\n   [Behl, M.] Univ Georgia, Georgia Sea Grant Coll Program, Athens, GA 30602 USA.\\n   [Nof, D.] Florida State Univ, Inst Geophys Fluid Dynam, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.\\nRP Behl, M (通讯作者)，Florida State Univ, Dept Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.\\nEM mbehl@uga.edu\\nFU National Science Foundation [OCE-0752225, OCE-0928271, OCE-0545204,\\n   ARC-0902835, ARC-0453846]\\nFX This work was supported by National Science Foundation grants\\n   (OCE-0752225, OCE-0928271, OCE-0545204, ARC-0902835, and ARC-0453846).\\n   D.

Sea surface salinity (SSS) from the recently launched Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Aquarius SAC-D salinity missions are utilized to estimate the BLT. The MRM relates BLT to sea surface salinity (SSS), sea surface temperature (SST), and sea surface height anomalies (SSHA). Three regions where the BLT variability is most rigorous are selected to evaluate the performance of the MRM for 2012; the Southeast Arabian Sea (SEAS), Bay of Bengal (BoB), and Eastern Equatorial Indian Ocean (EEIO). The MRM derived BLT estimates are compared to gridded Argo and Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) BLTs. It is shown that different mechanisms are important for sustaining the BLT variability in each of the selected regions. Sensitivity tests show that SSS is the primary driver of the BLT within the MRM. Results suggest that salinity measurements obtained from Aquarius and SMOS can be useful for tracking and predicting the BLT in the Indian Ocean. Largest MRM errors occur along coastlines and near islands where land contamination skews the satellite SSS retrievals. The BLT evolution during 2012, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of the current model are discussed. BLT estimations using HYCOM simulations display large errors that are related to model layer structure and the selected BLT methodology.\\nC1 [Felton, Clifford S.; Subrahmanyam, Bulusu] Univ S Carolina, Marine Sci Program, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.\\n   [Subrahmanyam, Bulusu] Univ S Carolina, Dept Earth & Ocean Sci, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.\\n   [Murty, V.

Traditionally, MR wave analysis is carried out in a set of rectangular windows covering the radar field of view (FOV). The FOV is typically partially obstructed, e.g., due to the coastline or ship superstructures. Especially for ships that are subject to regular course changes, this results in an increased variability or error associated with wave parameters. Using MR measurements from R/P FLIP, acquired off California during the 2010 US Office of Naval Research (ONR) high resolution air-sea interaction (Hi-Res) experiment, this study quantifies the dependency of the radar-based 2D wave spectrum and parameters on range and azimuth. With the help of reference data from a nearby Datawell Waverider buoy, we propose empirical methods to remove the dependency and we illustrate their efficacy.\\nC1 [Lund, Bjoern; Collins, Clarence O.; Graber, Hans C.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USA.\\n   [Terrill, Eric] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.\\n   [Herbers, Thomas H.

Wyrtki Jets, wind-driven eastward flows in the upper 100 m that appear typically twice per year in boreal spring and fall, are a prominent feature of the ocean circulation in this region. Our results indicate that nonlinearity associated with these jets is an important element of the zonal momentum budget, with wind driven eastward momentum advected downward into the thermocline. This advection results in annually averaged zonal currents that flow against the zonal pressure gradient in the upper 200 m, such that there is no mean subsurface undercurrent in the Indian Ocean as there is in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Zonal momentum is further distributed along the equator by zonal advection, with eastward flow substantially enhanced in the eastern basin relative to the western basin. Meridional advection, though generally weak, tends to decelerate surface eastward flow along the equator. These results contrast with those from previous idealized wind-forced model experiments that primarily emphasized the importance of vertical momentum advection. Also, beyond semiannual period fluctuations, significant momentum advection results from a broad range of interacting processes, spanning intraseasonal to interannual time scales. We conclude that proper simulation of zonal flows along the equator in the Indian Ocean, including their climatically relevant impacts on the mass and heat balance, requires accurate representation of nonlinearities that derive from a broad range of time and space scales.\\nC1 [Nagura, Motoki] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Res Inst Global Change, Yokosuka, Kanagawa 2370061, Japan.\\n   [McPhaden, Michael J.] NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.\\nRP Nagura, M (通讯作者)，Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Res Inst Global Change, 2-15 Natsushimacho, Yokosuka, Kanagawa 2370061, Japan.\\nEM nagura@jamstec.go.jp\\nRI McPhaden, Michael J/D-9799-2016\\nOI McPhaden, Michael J/0000-0002-8423-5805\\nNR 59\\nTC 17\\nZ9 18\\nU1 0\\nU2 12\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

This is mostly due to memory limitations on data, but also, it is thought that buoy measurements of sea surface elevation are not as accurate as wave gauges mounted on stationary platforms. Accurate records of eta which contain rogue waves (defined here as an individual wave at least twice the significant wave height) are of great interest to scientists and engineers. Using field data, procedures for tilt correcting and double integrating accelerometer data to produce a consistent record of eta are given in this study. The data in this study are from experimental buoys deployed in the recent Impact of Typhoons on the Ocean in the Pacific (ITOP) field experiment which occurred in 2010. The statistics from the ITOP buoys is under that predicted by Rayleigh theory, but matches the distributions of Boccotti and others (Tayfun and Fedele) (Ocean Eng 34:1631-1649, 2007). Rogue waves were recorded throughout the experiment under various sea state conditions. Recommendations, as a result of lessons learned during ITOP, are made for the routine recording of eta which may not add significantly to the existing data burden. The hope is that we might one day collect a worldwide database of rogue waves from the existing buoy network, which would progress our understanding of the rogue wave phenomenon and make work at sea safer.\\nC1 [Collins, Clarence O., III; Lund, Bjoern; Graber, Hans C.] Univ Miami, Miami, FL 33149 USA.\\n   [Waseda, Takuji] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778563, Japan.\\nRP Collins, CO (通讯作者)，Univ Miami, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA.\\nEM Tripphysicist@gmail.com\\nRI Collins, Clarence/P-7384-2015; Waseda, Takuji/F-1445-2019\\nOI Collins, Clarence/0000-0003-4553-616X; Waseda,\\n   Takuji/0000-0001-5403-5303\\nFU U.S. Office of Naval Research [N00014-09-0392]; National Science\\n   Foundation; Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science; Grants-in-Aid\\n   for Scientific Research [25106705] Funding Source: KAKEN\\nFX COCIII would like to acknowledge friends at the University of Tokyo who\\n   were very generous and hospitable during the summer of 2013.

Seven initial particle release sites are selected in key gulf regions often affected by harmful algal (Alexandrium fundyense) blooms, including Massachusetts Bay, the western GOM coastal area, the eastern GOM coastal area, the Bay of Fundy, Wilkinson Basin, the Jordan Basin, and a region seaward of Penobscot Bay. Surface particles are released every 5 days between February 1st and August 1st in each year, and the variability in their trajectories on interannual time scales is quantified by Lagrangian probability density function calculations. Coastal connectivity is further quantified using a connectivity matrix, identifying source and destination functions. Our results suggest that the interannual variability in coastal connectivity has strong impact on the spatial distribution of A. fundyense blooms in each year. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the mechanisms by which flows can be sustained over these distances remain enigmatic. In this paper we consider two shallow water models the first assumes the flow is unstratified whilst the second uses empirical models to describe vertical stratification, which effects depth averaged mass and momentum transfer. The importance of stratification is elucidated through comparison of modeled flow dynamics. It is found that the vertically stratified model shows the best fit to field data from a channelized field-scale gravity current in the Black Sea. Moreover, the stratified flow is confined by the channel to a much greater degree than the flow in the unstratified model. However, both models fail to accurately represent flow dynamics in the distal end of the system, suggesting current empirical stratification models require improvement to accurately describe field-scale gravity currents. It also highlights the limitations of weakly stratified small-scale experiments in describing field-scale processes. The results suggest that in real-world systems stratification is likely to enable maintenance of velocity and discharge within the channel, thus facilitating sediment suspension over distances of hundreds of kilometers on low seafloor gradients. This explains how flows can travel remarkable distances and transport their sediment to the distal parts of submarine fans.\\n   Key Points\\n   <list id=\"jgrc20656-list-0001\" list-type=\"bulleted\"> <list-item id=\"jgrc20656-li-0001\">Vertical stratification of density-driven flows enhances runout length <list-item id=\"jgrc20656-li-0002\">Existing empirical models under predict flow stratification <list-item id=\"jgrc20656-li-0003\">Stratification may explain formation of sandy lobes at the end of submarine fans\\nC1 [Dorrell, R.

Two distinct submarine groundwater sources including water from the unconfined surficial aquifer discharging at the beach face and water from a deeper aquifer discharging nearshore through submarine springs (ojos) were identified. The groundwater of nearshore ojos was saline and significantly enriched in short-lived radium isotopes (Ra-223, Ra-224) relative to the unconfined aquifer beach face groundwater. We estimated SGD from ojos using Ra-223 and used a salinity mass balance to estimate the freshwater discharge at the beach face. Analytical calculations were also used to estimate wave set-up and tidally driven saline seepage into the surf zone and were compared to the salinity-based freshwater discharge estimates. Results suggest that average SGD from ojos along the Yucatan Peninsula Caribbean coast is on the order of 308 m(3) d(-1) m(-1) and varies between sampling regions. Higher discharge was observed in the southern regions (568 m(3) d(-1) m(-1)) compared to the north (48 m(3) d(-1) m(-1)). Discharge at the beach face was in the range of 3.3-8.5 m(3) d(-1) m(-1) for freshwater and 2.7 m(3) d(-1) m(-1) for saline water based on the salinity mass balance and wave- and tidally-driven discharge, respectively. Although discharge from the ojos was larger in volume than discharge from the unconfined aquifer at the beach face, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) was significantly higher in beach groundwater; thus, discharge of this unconfined beach aquifer groundwater contributed significantly to total DIN loading to the coast. DIN fluxes were up to 9.9 mol d(-1) m(-1) from ojos and 2.1 mol d(-1) m(-1) from beach discharge and varied regionally along the 500 km coastline sampled. These results demonstrate the importance of considering the beach zone as a significant nutrient source to coastal waters for future management strategies regarding nutrient loading to reef environments and coastal development. This study also identifies the importance of understanding the connectivity of submarine spring discharge to the nearshore coastal environment and the impact of inland anthropogenic activities may have on coastal health.

The bay is characterized by seasonally recurrent hypoxia (<1.42 ml l(-1)) associated with a deep pool of oxygen-depleted water and episodic anoxia (<0.02 ml l(-1)) driven by the nearshore (<20 m isobath) decay of red tide. Coastal wind forcing influences DO concentrations in the nearshore through its influence on bay productivity and the development of red tides; through shoreward advection of the bottom pool of oxygen-depleted water as determined by the upwelling-downwelling cycle; and through its control of water column stratification and mixing. A seasonal decline in bottom DO concentrations of approximate to 1.2 ml l(-1) occurs with a concurrent expansion of the bottom pool of oxygen depleted water in St Helena Bay. Upwelling of this water into the nearshore causes severe drops in DO concentration (<0.2 ml l(-1)), particularly during end-of-season upwelling, resulting in a significant narrowing of the habitable zone. Episodic anoxia through the entire water column is caused by localized degradation of red tides within the confines of the shallow nearshore environment. Oxygenation of the nearshore is achieved by ventilation of the water column particularly with the onset of winter mixing. No notable changes are evident in comparing recent measures of bottom DO concentrations in St Helena Bay to data collected in the late 1950s and early 1960s.\\n   Key Points\\n   <list id=\"jgrc20639-list-0001\" list-type=\"bulleted\"> <list-item id=\"jgrc20639-li-0001\">Phenology of coastal upwelling influences bay productivity and red tides <list-item id=\"jgrc20639-li-0002\">Bay is subject to seasonally recurrent hypoxia and episodic anoxia <list-item id=\"jgrc20639-li-0003\">No change in deep pool of seasonally hypoxic water over past 50 years\\nC1 [Pitcher, Grant C.; Probyn, Trevor A.; du Randt, Andre] Dept Agr Forestry & Fisheries, Cape Town, South Africa.\\n   [Pitcher, Grant C.; Hutchings, Larry] Univ Cape Town, Marine Res Inst, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa.\\n   [Lucas, Andrew J.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.\\n   [Bernard, Stewart] CSIR, Cape Town, South Africa.\\n   [Bernard, Stewart; Evers-King, Haley] Univ Cape Town, Dept Oceanog, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa.\\n   [Lamont, Tarron] Dept Environm Affairs, Cape Town, South Africa.\\nRP Pitcher, GC (通讯作者)，Dept Agr Forestry & Fisheries, Cape Town, South Africa.\\nEM GrantP@daff.gov.za\\nOI Lamont, Tarron/0000-0001-8464-891X; Bernard,\\n   Stewart/0000-0001-6537-3682; Lucas, Andrew/0000-0001-7722-7252\\nFU NSF [OISE-0853106]\\nFX Alistair Busby, Brett Lewis and Neil van den Heever are thanked for\\n   their contribution in the field.

The meiotic chromosome configuration of 3 tetraploid and 1 tetraploid/triploid mosaic males were analyzed through direct chromosome observation. A majority of metaphase I spermatocytes contained both bivalents and quadrivalents. The chromosome configuration of these males was characterized by preferential formation of bivalents to quadrivalents. Bivalents appeared in all spermatocytes and consisted of 86% of all chromosome aggregates. In comparison, quadrivalents occurred in 91% spermatocytes and consisted of only 12.6% of all chromosome aggregates. The mean bivalent frequency per spermatocyte varied between 14.4 and 17.2; while that of quadrivalents varied between 2.2 and 2.7. Most quadrivalents were tandemly chained (58%) or circled (39%). The total number of chromosome aggregates per spermatocyte ranged from 13 to 20 with an average of 17.6; while 18 (16 bivalents and 2 quadrivalents) was the most frequent. Univalents and trivalents appeared in very low frequency. Aneuploid (hypotetraploid) spermatocytes were observed in a low frequency. The chromosome configuration of in the mosaic individual was similar to that of tetraploid individuals. The percentage of triploid spermatocytes (2%) of the mosaic individual was significantly lower (chi (2) =30, P < 0.01) than that of triploid cells (46%) in its somatic tissue.\\nC1 [Zhang Zhengrui; Wang Xinglian; Zhang Quanqi] Ocean Univ China, Coll Marine Life Sci, Key Lab Marine Genet & Breeding, Minist Educ, Qingdao 266003, Peoples R China.\\n   [Allen, Standish, Jr.] Coll William & Mary, Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Aquaculture Genet & Breeding Technol Ctr, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA.\\nRP Zhang, QQ (通讯作者)，Ocean Univ China, Coll Marine Life Sci, Key Lab Marine Genet & Breeding, Minist Educ, Qingdao 266003, Peoples R China.\\nEM qzhang@ouc.edu.cn\\nNR 48\\nTC 4\\nZ9 4\\nU1 0\\nU2 23\\nPU OCEAN UNIV CHINA\\nPI QINGDAO\\nPA 5 YUSHAN RD, QINGDAO, 266003, PEOPLES R CHINA\\nSN 1672-5182\\nEI 1993-5021\\nJ9 J OCEAN U CHINA\\nJI J.

In this article, the radioactive releases from this event are compared to natural and prior human sources, with particular attention to cesium-137 and -134 radioisotopes. Total releases from Fukushima are not well constrained, with estimates from atmospheric fallout and direct ocean discharge spanning 4 to 90 peta Becquerels (PBq), but are most likely in the 15-30 PBq range. This source is smaller than any Cs-137 remaining in the North Pacific from global and close-in fallout from the 1960s. It is of similar magnitude to Cs-137 released to the ocean from the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing site on the Irish Sea, though of greater magnitude than fallout that reached the ocean from the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster in the Ukraine. The fate of Cs is largely determined by its soluble nature in seawater, though uptake in sediments does occur via cesium\\'s association with both detrital particles and biological uptake and sedimentation. A mass balance of Cs supply from rivers and ongoing leakage from nuclear power plants suggests that sediments will remain contaminated for decades. This may be one reason why Cs concentrations in benthic fish stay elevated over predictions, causing fisheries to remain closed near Fukushima and ongoing concern to the public.\\nC1 Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Marine Chem & Geochem, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\nRP Buesseler, KO (通讯作者)，Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Marine Chem & Geochem, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\nEM kbuesseler@whoi.edu\\nNR 51\\nTC 61\\nZ9 71\\nU1 5\\nU2 89\\nPU OCEANOGRAPHY SOC\\nPI ROCKVILLE\\nPA P.O.

Five different types deep-water energy installations with depths ranging from 320 to 995 m, and three shipwrecks with depths ranging from approximately 530 to 615 m, were examined. Density, depth ranges, and growth rates of L. pertusa colonies were calculated from video and image analysis. L pertusa colonies were present on all structures examined. Minimum calculated growth rates for the largest colonies ranged from 0.32 to 3.23 cm/yr on the different structures. The shallowest depth at which L pertusa was observed was 201 m and the deepest was 801 m, considerably expanding the known depth range of this species in the northern GoM. Colony density varied with structure type, age, and depth, with the highest density between 503 and 518 m on the single structure that spanned the entire depth range of occurrence of L pertusa observed in this study. L pertusa colonies growing on thinner and deeper installations appear to have higher colonization rates, i.e. to develop higher densities over a shorter time period, compared to those on shallower and more massive types of installations. However, on average, colonies have slower growth rates on these installations than colonies on more massive, shallower installations (compliant and solid installations). In general, the calculated minimum growth rates were higher on the installations than on the shipwrecks, which were substantially older. A continuum of colony sizes was documented on all installations, suggesting multiple settlement events. L pertusa thickets were observed on the oldest anthropogenic structures, with most of the components of these structures covered by colonies of L pertusa. Brown, orange, and mottled color-variants were documented for the first time in the GoM. All installations examined for this study were colonized by L pertusa and it is likely that most artificial surfaces in appropriate depths in the GoM will be as well. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The TZ is a broad region that regularly exhibits chlorophyll concentrations of 1-2 mu g L-1 throughout the spring, summer, and fall seasons. Surface transect and vertical profile data from three cruises (May 2010, June 1999, and August 2011) between 34 and 42 N show residual nitrate concentrations (5-15 mu M) and low Fe concentrations (most <0.2 nmol kg(-1)) in the TZ. We therefore suggest that much of the TZ of the cCCS is an Fe-limited, high nutrient, lower than expected chlorophyll (HNLC) region. The main source of Fe to the cCCS is from upwelling through the benthic boundary layer (BBL) over the continental shelf sediments. Iron and NO in coastally upwelled water are transported via offshore moving filaments into the TZ. However, since some coastal upwelling regions with narrow continental shelves do not have much Fe to begin with, and since Fe is drawn down more rapidly relative to NO3- due to biological assimilation and scavenging, these filaments transport low concentrations of Fe relative to NO into the TZ. Weak wind curl-induced upwelling and vertical mixing in the TZ also deliver Fe and NO3- to the surface but at lower concentrations (and lower Fe:NO3-) than from strong coastal upwelling. Mesoscale cyclonic eddies in the TZ are important to consider with respect to offshore surface nutrient delivery because there is a marked shoaling of isopycnals and the nutricline within these eddies allowing higher nutrient concentrations to be closer to the surface. Since wind curlinduced upwelling and/or vertical mixing occurs seaward of the continental shelf, there is not enough Fe delivered to the surface to accompany the NO;. By using Fe:NO3- ratios and calculated specific growth rates for diatoms, we demonstrate that the TZ of the cCCS shows evidence for Fe limitation of diatom blooms. The TZ also appears to progress further into Fe limitation as the upwelling season progresses from spring into late summer. This study provides some of the first field data to suggest that Fe is a critical bottom up control on the ecosystem in the TZ of the cCCS. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The results from POP are in good agreement with KESS observations. POP captures the lateral and vertical structure of mean-to-eddy energy conversion rates, which range from 2 to 10 cm(2) s(-3). The dynamical mechanism of vertical coupling between the deep and upper ocean is the process responsible for DEHFs in POP and is in accordance with baroclinic instability observed in the Gulf Stream and Kuroshio Extension. Meridional eddy heat transport values are similar to 14% larger in POP at its maximum value. This is likely due to the more zonal path configuration in POP. The results from this study suggest that HR POP is a useful tool for estimating eddy statistics in the Kuroshio Extension region, and thereby provide guidance in the formulation and testing of eddy mixing parameterization schemes.\\nC1 [Bishop, Stuart P.; Bryan, Frank O.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.\\nRP Bishop, SP (通讯作者)，Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.\\nEM sbishop@ucar.edu\\nRI Bryan, Frank O/I-1309-2016\\nOI Bryan, Frank O/0000-0003-1672-8330\\nFU National Science Foundation (NSF); NSF [OCE02-21008, OCE08-51246]\\nFX The authors thank Peter Gent and Justin Small for helpful comments that\\n   improved this manuscript.

Subinertial alongshore surface currents show poleward propagating signals with phase speeds of O(10) and O(100-300) kmd-1 that are consistent with historical in situ observations off the USWC and that can be possibly interpreted as coastally trapped waves (CTWs). The propagating signals in the slow mode are partly observed in southern California, which may result from scattering and reflection of higher-mode CTWs due to curvature of shoreline and bathymetry near Point Conception, California. On the other hand, considering the order of the phase speed in the slow mode, the poleward propagating signals may be attributed to alongshore advection or pressure-driven flows. A statistical regression of coastal winds at National Data Buoy Center buoys on the observed surface currents partitions locally and remotely wind-forced components, isolates footprints of the equatorward propagating storm events in winter off the USWC, and shows the poleward propagating signals year round.\\nC1 [Kim, Sung Yong] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Div Ocean Syst Engn, Sch Mech Aerosp & Syst Engn, Taejon 305701, South Korea.\\n   [Cornuelle, Bruce D.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.\\n   [Terrill, Eric J.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Marine Phys Lab, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.\\n   [Jones, Burt] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Red Sea Res Ctr, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia.\\n   [Washburn, Libe] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog, ICESS, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.\\n   [Moline, Mark A.] Univ Delaware, Coll Earth Ocean & Environm, Sch Marine Sci & Policy, Newark, DE USA.\\n   [Paduan, Jeffrey D.] Naval Postgrad Sch, Grad Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Dept Oceanog, Monterey, CA USA.\\n   [Garfield, Newell] San Francisco State Univ, Dept Geosci, Tiburon, CA USA.\\n   [Garfield, Newell] San Francisco State Univ, Romberg Tiburon Ctr Environm Studies, Tiburon, CA USA.\\n   [Largier, John L.] Univ Calif Davis, Bodega Marine Lab, Bodega Bay, CA USA.\\n   [Crawford, Greg] Vancouver Isl Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, Nanaimo, BC, Canada.\\n   [Kosro, P.

There was no evidence for within-site or between-site genetic differentiation for either species. While E. ohtai manusensis showed limited genetic variation, V cf. parensis showed greater variation, with sequences distributed between two divergent groups. Assuming the cytochrome oxidase I gene is not under selection, significantly negative Tajima\\'s D in E. ohtai manusensis is consistent with a recent population expansion due to a bottleneck or founder effect, whereas V cf. parensis (combined groups) did not depart from a stable effective population size. Considering the groups separately, V cf. parensis Group 1 (but not Group 2) showed a negative Tajima\\'s D, indicating these groups may have encountered different historical demographic conditions. Data reported here are part of a baseline study against which recovery of genetic diversity following mineral extraction at Solwara 1 can be measured. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The few studies that are available, based either on in situ data or on numerical modeling, seems to agree that the region is characterized by relatively weak baroclinic flow, with substantial mesoscale activity, which is quite different from other western boundary current systems (e.g. Florida Current, in the North Atlantic). We present numerical simulations that show that the main realistic mesoscale features in the eddy-rich vicinities of the BC site of origin can be successfully modeled through the dynamical interaction between parameterized versions of two opposing mean western boundary currents (BC and North Brazil Undercurrent NBUC) and local topography, with no influence of remote dynamics or atmospheric forcing. Large BC-related anticyclones observed in previous work were reproduced and recurrently formed during the model run. Two additional sensitivity experiments were performed. When NBUC is removed from the physical setting, the BC interaction with topography is not sufficient to generate eddies similar to observations. When an idealized flat-bottom and a physiographic configuration with no Abrolhos and Royal Charlotte Banks are considered, the BC-NBUC interaction is also not capable of developing realistic mesoscale structures. Our geophysical instability analyses suggest that BC-NBUC vertical shear is promoting baroclinic energy fluxes from the mean flow to the perturbations, resulting in eddy formation and growth in the region.

Salt marshes also mitigate the impacts of hurricanes and tsunamis, and sequester large volumes of carbon in their peat soil. Understanding the mechanisms responsible for marsh stability or deterioration is therefore a key issue for society. Sea level rise is often viewed as the main driver of salt marsh deterioration. However, while salt marshes can reach equilibrium in the vertical direction, they are inherently unstable in the horizontal direction. Marsh expansion driven by sediment supply rarely matches lateral erosion by waves, creating a dynamic landscape. Recent results show that marsh collapse can occur in the absence of sea level rise if the rate at which sediment is eroded at marsh boundaries is higher than the input of sediment from nearby rivers or from the continental shelf. We propose that the horizontal dynamics and related sediment fluxes are key factors determining the survival of salt marshes. Only a complete sediment budget between salt marshes and nearby tidal flats can determine the fate of marshes at any given location, with sea level rise being only one among many external drivers.

In this study, we examined the vertical and temporal variability in planktonic Chromalveolate (hereafter chromophyte) assemblages over a 2-year period (2007-2009) at Station ALOHA (22 degrees 45\\'N, 158 degrees W) in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, cloning, and sequencing of form ID rbcL genes from samples collected at nearly monthly intervals provided information on the diversity, abundances, and variability associated with chromophytic phytoplankton. Despite persistently oligotrophic conditions, the euphotic zone of this habitat supported a phylogenetically diverse assemblage of chromophytic algae, including representatives of various genera of diatoms, pelagophytes, prymnesiophytes, and dinoflagellates. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) amplification of diatom, prymnesiophyte, and pelagophyte rbcL phylotypes revealed that the population structure of these assemblages was highly variable in time, with gene abundances often varying more than an order of magnitude between successive months. Diatom rbcL genes were typically the most abundant in both the upper and lower regions of the euphotic zone, while rbcL gene abundances of the prymnesiophytes and pelagophytes were significantly greater (One-way ANOVA, P<0.05) in the lower regions of the euphotic zone (75-125 m) than in the upper euphotic zone (5-45 m). Similarly, we observed elevated concentrations of 19-hexanoxyfucoxanthin and 19-butanoxyfucoxanin (diagnostic pigments of prymnesiophytes and pelagophytes, respectively) in the lower euphotic zone, while concentrations of fucoxanthin (a diagnostic diatom pigment) demonstrated less vertical structure. Analyses of samples collected using sediment traps deployed at 150 m revealed that members of diatoms, prymnesiophytes, and pelagophytes all contributed to material export out of the upper ocean. None of the phytoplankton groups displayed significant seasonality in gene abundances or fluxes over the period of observations. Our study confirms that diatoms are ubiquitous and diverse members of the euphotic zone phytoplankton assemblage in the NPSG, while prymnesiophytes and pelagophytes appear to capitalize on the relatively nutrient-enriched but low light conditions characteristic of the deeper euphotic zone waters. The combined use of molecular- and pigment-based tools demonstrated that despite persistently oligotrophic conditions chromophytic plankton are perennial contributors to upper ocean biomass and particle export in the NPSG.

Here, we highlight structural and functional features of pelagic OMZ zooplankton communities, especially the little known mesopelagic lower oxycline zooplankton assemblage in the eastern tropical north Pacific (ETNP). Day and night vertically-stratified zooplankton samples were collected with a MOCNESS plankton net system to depths of 1000 m during two cruises in 2007 and 2008 as part of the Eastern Tropical Pacific Project. Size-fractionated biomass and selected species distributions were analyzed. A spatial comparison between two stations, Tehuantepec Bowl (TB) and Costa Rica Dome (CRD), with different OMZ thicknesses especially in 2008, was used as a proxy for future potential climate change to show how variability in oxycline depth at the upper and lower OMZ boundaries may have broad consequences for biological distributions and ecosystem function.\\n   The same zooplankton biomass features were present at both locations but responded differently to changes in OMZ thickness and boundary depths. The impact of habitat compression was quantified by the change in proportion of zooplankton biomass in the upper water column. The thermocline was the location of peak zooplankton biomass regardless of OMZ extent. At the lower oxycline, a unique zooplankton assemblage and secondary biomass peak (sharp order of magnitude jump from OMZ core biomass levels) occurred that was strongly associated with a specific oxygen concentration of 2 mu M. In 2008, the lower oxycline biomass peak deepened by over 200 m at TB with its expanded OMZ compared to CRD, despite a temperature difference of similar to 2 degrees C, while remaining at the same oxygen level. In contrast, another secondary biomass peak corresponding to the daytime depth of did l vertical migration, and occurring within the upper oxycline or OMZ core, was present at the same depth and temperature at both locations, despite different oxygen concentrations. A dense monospecific layer of the copepod Eucalanus inermis was sometimes present just above the distinctive more persistent lower oxycline assemblage. While the general ontogenetic migration of this species was previously known, its precise positioning relative to oxygen concentration and the lower oxycline community is a new finding. The vertical re-positioning of biomass layers at the thermocline and lower OMZ boundaries, and the increased depth range of low oxygen water that diel vertical migrators and sinking particles must transit in an expanded OMZ, could have widespread effects on species distributions, the biological pump, and benthic-pelagic coupling.

In this, the surface density is linked to the subsurface fields via the surface quasigeostrophic (SQG) formalism, as proposed in several recent papers. The subsurface field is augmented by the addition of the barotropic and first baroclinic modes, whose amplitudes are determined by matching to the sea surface height (pressure), after subtracting the SQG contribution. An additional constraint is that the bottom pressure anomaly vanishes. The method is tested for three regions in the North Atlantic using data from a high-resolution numerical simulation. The decomposition yields strikingly realistic subsurface fields. It is particularly successful in energetic regions like the Gulf Stream extension and at high latitudes where the mixed layer is deep, but it also works in less energetic eastern subtropics. The demonstration highlights the possibility of reconstructing three-dimensional oceanic flows using a combination of satellite fields, for example, sea surface temperature (SST) and SSH, and sparse (or climatological) estimates of the regional depth-resolved density. The method could be further elaborated to integrate additional subsurface information, such as mooring measurements.\\nC1 [Wang, Jinbo; Mahadevan, Amala] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\n   [Flierl, Glenn R.] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.\\n   [LaCasce, Joseph H.] Univ Oslo, Dept Geosci, Oslo, Norway.\\n   [McClean, Julie L.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.\\nRP Wang, JB (通讯作者)，Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, MS 29, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\nEM jinbow@alum.mit.edu\\nRI Wang, Jinbo/H-1174-2015\\nOI Wang, Jinbo/0000-0001-5034-5566; LaCasce, Joseph\\n   Henry/0000-0001-7655-5596\\nFU NASA [NNX12AD47G]; NSF [OCE 0928617]; Office of Naval Research; Office\\n   of Science (BER), U.S. Department of Energy [DE-GF0205ER64119]; NORSEE\\n   (Nordic Seas Eddy Exchanges); Norwegian Research Council; \\n   [OCE-0752346]; Division Of Ocean Sciences [0960826, 0928617, 0928138]\\n   Funding Source: National Science Foundation\\nFX We thank Shafer Smith for helpful comments.

Substrata were recovered after 3-month and 6-month exposure periods and searched intensively for invertebrate colonists. Recruitment surfaces were colonized during every exposure period by three species of cocculiniform limpets, Cocculina rathbuni, Cocculina emsoni, and Notocrater youngi. At least two species appeared in each season, but the relative numbers varied in a way that may indicate seasonal differences in reproduction. Gonad development could be observed through the transparent shell of C. rathbuni, which attained sexual maturity in less than 3 months and had a maximum instantaneous fecundity of 40 eggs. Growth rates (0.025-0.044 mm/day) were high when scaled to adult body size. We used current-meter data from the deployment site to calculate the fluxes of larvae that would be required to produce the measured levels of recruitment. Observed recruitment would require larval densities of hundreds of thousands to millions of larvae per km(3). Nevertheless, it is remarkable that these snails are able to succeed with an opportunistic strategy given their low fecundity and lecithotrophic development. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

With a width of about 5 km, the steep-sided bank rises from water depths of over 100 m to within less than 20 m of the surface. Four acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) moorings and four temperature/salinity strings were deployed around the EFGB with an additional ADCP on top of the bank for about 1 year. The main objective was to understand the ocean processes over the EFGB and to examine the importance of the topographically induced processes on shelf edge circulation on longer (e.g. days to seasonal) time scales. Currents were generally eastward over the bank in the upper water column. Eddy events occasionally reversed the eastward flow for a few days. Currents in the lower water column tended to align with the bank\\'s bathymetry and mostly were directed offshore at the southern edge of the bank. Wind and eddy events moved both shelf and off-shelf waters over the bank, including waters from as deep as 200 m through upwelling and/or mixing processes. Mixed layers changed by as much as 50 m in a couple of days. inertial currents occurred throughout the year and were often much larger than the tidal currents. Commonly, the inertial currents were strong enough to reverse the predominantly eastward current flow on time scales of less than a day. Westward propagating cyclonic eddies (often associated with anticyclonic eddies) likely connect biological activities of the EFGB with the West Flower Garden Bank. Banks such as the EFGB, with large aspect ratios and heights, strongly alter circulation and enhance exchange processes at the shelf break. Published by Elsevier Ltd.\\nC1 [Teague, W.

Nonetheless, it has been proposed that the EDW could serve as an important short-term sink of anthropogenic CO2. The objective of the present investigation was to determine sea-air CO2 gas exchange rates and seawater CO2 dynamics during wintertime formation of EDW in the North Atlantic Ocean. During 2006 and 2007, several research cruises were undertaken as part of the CLIMODE project across the northwest Atlantic Ocean with the intent to study the pre-conditioning, formation, and the evolution of EDW. Sea-air CO2 exchange rates were calculated based on measurements of atmospheric pCO(2), surface seawater pCO(2) and wind speed with positive values denoting a net flux from the surface ocean to the atmosphere. Average sea-air CO2 flux calculated along cruise tracks in the formation region equaled -18 +/- 6 mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1) and -14 +/- 9 mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1) in January of 2006 and March of 2007, respectively. Average sea-air CO2 flux in newly formed outcropping EDW in February and March of 2007 equaled -28 +/- 10 mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1). These estimates exceeded previous flux estimates in this region by 40-185%. The magnitude of CO2 flux was mainly controlled by the observed variability in wind speed and Delta pCO(2) with smaller changes owing to variability in sea surface temperature. Small but statistically significant difference (4.1 +/- 2.6 mu mol kg(-1)) in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) was observed in two occurrences of newly formed EDW in February and March of 2007. This difference was explained either by differences in the relative contribution from different water masses involved in the initial formation process of EDW or temporal changes owing to sea-air CO2 exchange (similar to 25%) and vertical and/or lateral mixing (similar to 75%) with water masses high in DIC from the cold side of the Gulf Stream and/or from below the permanent thermocline. Based on the present estimate of sea-air CO2 flux in newly formed EDW and a formation rate of 9.3 Sv y (Sverdrup year = 10(6) m(3) s(-1) flow sustained for 1 year), CO2 uptake by newly formed EDW may constitute 3-6% of the total North Atlantic CO2 sink. However, advection of surface waters that carry an elevated burden of anthropogenic CO2 that are transported to the formation region and transformed to mode water may contribute additional CO2 to the total net uptake and sequestration of anthropogenic CO2 to the ocean interior.

In the North Atlantic, this water mass is known as Eighteen Degree Water (EDW), while the corresponding water mass in the Pacific is identified as North Pacific Subtropical Mode Water (NPSTMW). This analysis compares properties of EDW with NPSTMW as well as the intrinsic oceanic variability of both, within the framework of a high resolution model with climatological atmospheric forcing. Interannual variability is evident in both volume and characteristics of EDW and NPSTMW, but the magnitude of variability is small, indicating that observed variability is largely forced by atmospheric changes. Volume of EDW is greater than volume of NPSTMW, but volume variability is similar in the two basins, and is dominated by the seasonal cycle in both cases. The most significant differences are found in the average ages of EDW compared to NPSTMW. Although the volume of STMW formed in each basin is similar, different circulation patterns lead to a higher average age in the North Atlantic, as EDW is more likely to be advected away from the formation region and remain subducted in the North Atlantic, while NPSTMW is more likely to be reventilated the following winter in the North Pacific.

Larvae are given a suite of idealized behaviors designed to reveal the importance of the surface boundary layer (SBL) to transport and settlement. Larvae remain near 5 m, 30 m, or transition between these depths using various strategies, including diel vertical migration (DVM) and ontogenetic vertical migration. Some behaviors result in modeled densities qualitatively similar to observed cross-shelf larval distributions. By remaining primarily below the SBL, larvae released from central California are 500 times more likely to be retained within 5 km of the coast at 30 days from release relative to those that stay near surface, and 145 times more likely to settle along the coast within a 30 to 60 day pelagic larval duration. For most behaviors, nearshore retention over time could be approximated as a modified exponential decay process. Vertical swimming also greatly affects alongshore dispersal, with each behavior resulting in a unique structure of alongshore settlement. Maintaining a depth near 30 m increases settlement throughout most of the CCS by at least an order of magnitude relative to passive larvae. Remaining near surface reduces settlement from Pt. Conception to Pt. Arena, but has less of an effect north of Cape Mendocino. Relative to passive larvae, DVM increases settlement in regional \"hotspots,\" but does not greatly alter overall recruitment in the CCS, and ontogenetic vertical migration increases settlement for central California regions south of Bodega Bay.\\nC1 [Drake, Patrick T.; Edwards, Christopher A.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ocean Sci Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.\\n   [Morgan, Steven G.] Univ Calif Davis, Bodega Marine Lab, Bodega Bay, CA USA.\\n   [Morgan, Steven G.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA.\\n   [Dever, Edward P.] Oregon State Univ, Coll Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.\\nRP Drake, PT (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ocean Sci Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.\\nEM pdrake@ucsc.edu\\nOI Edwards, Christopher/0000-0002-2100-5674\\nFU California Sea Grant [R/FISH-218A]\\nFX We thank three anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments.

To observe river discharge using ATI, surface velocity measurements need to be converted to depth-integrated velocity to apply empirical discharge models and, possibly aliased, tidal signals need to be removed. Problems may also arise from the fact that ATI velocity observations generally are not in the along-flow direction, and from uncertainties in applied empirical discharge models. To quantify the degree to which river discharge can be inferred from ATI data, output from a high-resolution numerical model of the Elbe estuary serves here as the basis for simulated observations of a TerraSAR-X-like satellite mission as well as simulated ground truth against which retrieved transports are tested. Results show that with only the additional information of the river widths, instantaneous discharge estimates can be obtained from ATI-derived velocities. To retrieve mean discharges from a number of instantaneous measurements at different tidal phases, we fit time series of the tidal components M-2 and K-1 to the data by amplitude and phase adjustment and subtract them. We demonstrate the successful application of such a mean-value estimator for calculating net discharges. A simulated TerraSAR-X sampling scenario provides discharge estimates for the Elbe estuary with accuracies in the range of 20-30%, comparable in quality to commonly used ground-based noncontact discharge measurements. The proposed satellite-based monitoring approach, therefore, provides a promising new method for river discharge estimates in estuaries, especially in regions where onsite measurements are not possible or data are not accessible.\\nC1 [Gruenler, S.; Stammer, D.] Univ Hamburg, Inst Meereskunde, Ctr Erdsyst Forsch & Nachhaltigkeit, Hamburg, Germany.\\n   [Romeiser, R.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USA.\\nRP Grunler, S (通讯作者)，Fed Waterways Engn & Res Inst BAW, Wedeler Landstr 157, D-22559 Hamburg, Germany.\\nEM steffen.gruenler@baw.de\\nOI Grunler, Steffen/0000-0001-9852-0626\\nFU DFG [STA410/8-1]\\nFX Valuable comments from M.

Yield strength, Young\\'s modulus, and tensile fracture toughness measurements revealed seasonal changes in the behavior of these tidally influenced sediments. In summer, both flats and channel sediment behaviors were similar, while during winter, channel sediments were much weaker than sediments on the flats. Sediments typically displayed an increasingly elastic and fracture behavior with depth below the surface, with the exception of winter channel deposits, which deformed viscously. Porosity was inversely correlated to the measured geotechnical properties, resulting in increased strength with depth. In addition, each mechanical property was linearly proportional to one another. Average grain size did not differ within the field site, eliminating any effect that changing grain size might have on the mechanical behavior and strength. Overall, compressive and tensile strengths were low in shallow Willapa Bay sediments (< 20 cm). (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, hydrodynamic mechanisms must efficiently export mud off the flats. This study evaluates short-term deposition and long-term burial of mud on an intertidal flat and links seabed deposits to sediment-transport processes. To investigate the fine-grained sediment-transport mechanisms within the sandy Skagit River tidal flats, seabed and water-column observations were collected seasonally from 2008 to 2009 under varying river discharge conditions. Little mud was observed deposited on the seabed. Spatially, mud was most common near channels and on the seaward flat edge. Its presence was temporary, and was typically observed following high river discharge. Strongest current velocities and high suspended-sediment concentrations were measured during spring tidal cycles with peaks in the late ebb. Maximum velocities were observed within channels, permitting for rapid transport of fine-grained particles to the seaward edge of the flat and export beyond. These physical processes also act to mobilize the mostly sandy seabed, which is reworked at various frequencies: on a semi-diurnal tidal timescale, both channel and flat seabeds are reworked to 1-2 cm; and over a decadal timescale, lateral channel migration acts to rework the seabed to 1-2 m, making the limited mud deposits available for export. Overall, channel networks on sandy tidal flats with fluvial input not only deliver fine-grained sediment to the flat, but also aid in the export of suspended sediment at ebb tides and in the release of muddy deposits through reworking of the seabed.

To study the iron-carbon interaction, a number of natural iron sources within the Antarctic Circumpolar Current have been targeted to quantify the resultant particulate organic carbon (POC) export. Three studies in particular near the Crozet Islands, Kerguelen Plateau, and Antarctic Peninsula have produced estimates of both dissolved iron (DFe) supply and POC export. For each area, we present a detailed synthesis of (234)Thorium-derived POC export and of the DFe budgets that fuel the substantial phytoplankton blooms observed in these areas. Furthermore, we discuss the nuances of calculating seasonal POC export, which is required to estimate the seasonal response of POC export to DFe fertilisation. To conclude, we review the relationship between DFe supply and POC export (C:Fe ratio) for these areas, which provides an estimate of POC export efficiency. Daily rates of POC export from the mixed layer of naturally Fe-enriched Southern Ocean blooms range from 15 to 32 mmol C m(-2) d(-1), with associated control sites typically exporting similar to 3-times less POC, (5 to 12 mmol C m(-2) d(-1)). Within each project, the 3-fold trend is also observed in estimates of seasonal POC export; however, variation between study regions shows up to a 4-fold difference (range 1.4-5.0 mol m(-2)). DFe supply is dominated by horizontal processes and spans an order of magnitude depending on the location (190-2700 nmol m(-2) d(-1)). Where the calculation of seasonal C:Fe ratios is possible, almost an order of magnitude variation (16,790-154,000) is observed between different Southern Ocean regions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The first phase consists of frequency-dependent characterization of the wave field in which dominant frequencies are estimated by Fourier transform while corresponding wave numbers are derived from spatial gradients in cross-spectral phase over analysis tiles that can be small, allowing high-spatial resolution. Coherent spatial structures at each frequency are extracted by frequency-dependent empirical orthogonal function (EOF). In phase two, depths are found that best fit weighted sets of frequency-wave number pairs. These are subsequently smoothed in time in phase 3 using a Kalman filter that fills gaps in coverage and objectively averages new estimates of variable quality with prior estimates. Objective confidence intervals are returned. Tests at Duck, NC, using 16 surveys collected over 2 years showed a bias and root-mean-square (RMS) error of 0.19 and 0.51 m, respectively but were largest near the offshore limits of analysis (roughly 500m from the camera) and near the steep shoreline where analysis tiles mix information from waves, swash and static dry sand. Performance was excellent for small waves but degraded somewhat with increasing wave height. Sand bars and their small-scale alongshore variability were well resolved. A single ground truth survey from a dissipative, low-sloping beach (Agate Beach, OR) showed similar errors over a region that extended several kilometers from the camera and reached depths of 14 m. Vector wave number estimates can also be incorporated into data assimilation models of nearshore dynamics.\\nC1 [Holman, Rob] Oregon State Univ, CEOAS, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.\\n   [Plant, Nathaniel] USGS, Coastal & Marine Sci Ctr, St Petersburg, FL USA.\\n   [Holland, Todd] NRL, Stennis Space Ctr, MS USA.\\nRP Holland, T (通讯作者)，Oregon State Univ, CEOAS, 104 Ocean Admin Bldg, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.\\nEM holman@coas.oregonstate.edu\\nRI Holland, K.

Surface (< 200 m) chlorophyll a (Chl a) across a similar to 1700 km north-south transect ranged between the seasonal average of 0.2 mu g Chl a L-1 to 1.8 mu g Chl a L-1 in an extensive Chl a-rich patch in the center of the transect. Limiting (< 20 mu mol kg(-1) O-2) DO concentrations were encountered as shallow as 24 m. Biomass of M-g in waters above the upper oxycline (UO) ranged between 5.6 mu g C L-1 and 36.6 mu g C L-1, with highest M-g biomass observed in locations with highest Chl a. Heterotrophic dinoflagellates contributed most, on average, to M-g biomass (41% to 53%), followed by aloricate spirotrich ciliates (24% to 29%) and heterotrophic nanoflagellates (11% to 33%). Biomass of M-g decreased, on average, over 96% in waters below the UO, but this decrease did not appear to be regulated by DO; M-g biomass more strongly correlated with Chl a (r=0.83, P < 0.001) and temperature (r=0.76, P < 0.001) at discrete depths than with DO (r=0.67, P < 0.001). Using a multiple stepwise regression model, Chl a alone accounted for 68% M-g biomass variability, whereas Chl a and temperature combined accounted for 84%. In two M-g grazing experiments we found that M-g removed 33% and 108% of surface primary production in the upper mixed layer. These estimates of M-g grazing, while limited in scope, fall within estimates from other regions of the equatorial Pacific Ocean, and help reinforce the paradigm that M-g are influential in regulating organic carbon dynamics in the eastern tropical Pacific. A primary finding from this study was that observations of M-g biomass are higher than previously reported for the ETNP. This observation suggests that the region\\'s complex air-sea interactions and the resultant positive influence on primary production and phytoplankton biomass can episodically support high biomass of a diverse M-g community.

An interactive 2-D spatial smoother within the sea-surface temperature (SST)-flux coupler is invoked in a separate run to isolate the impact of the mesoscale (similar to 50-200 km, in the oceanic sense) SST field felt by the atmosphere in the fully coupled run. For the HCS, SCOAR produces seasonal wind stress and wind stress curl patterns that agree better with QuikSCAT winds than those from RA2. The SCOAR downscaled wind stress distribution has substantially different impacts on the magnitude and structure of wind-driven upwelling processes along the coast compared to RA2. Along coastal locations such as Arica and Taltal, SCOAR and RA2 produce seasonally opposite signs in the total wind-driven upwelling transport. At San Juan, SCOAR shows that upwelling is mainly due to coastal Ekman upwelling transport, while in RA2 upwelling is mostly attributed to Ekman pumping. Fully coupled SCOAR shows significant SST-wind stress coupling during fall and winter, while smoothed SCOAR shows insignificant coupling throughout, indicating the important role of ocean mesoscale eddies on air-sea coupling in HCS. Coupling between SST, wind speed, and latent heat flux is incoherent in large-scale coupling and full coupling mode. In contrast, coupling between these three variables is clearly identified for oceanic mesoscales, which suggests that mesoscale SST affects latent heat directly through the bulk formulation, as well as indirectly through stability changes on the overlying atmosphere, which affects surface wind speeds. The SST-wind stress and SST-heat-flux couplings, however, fail to produce a strong change in the ocean eddy statistics. No rectified effects of ocean-atmosphere coupling were identified for either the atmospheric or oceanic mean conditions, suggesting that mesoscale coupling is too weak in this region to strongly alter the basic climate state.\\nC1 [Putrasahan, Dian A.; Miller, Arthur J.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.\\n   [Seo, Hyodae] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\nRP Putrasahan, DA (通讯作者)，Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA.\\nEM dputrasahan@rsmas.miami.edu\\nRI Seo, Hyodae/AAL-4263-2021\\nOI Seo, Hyodae/0000-0002-4352-5080; Miller, Arthur/0000-0003-3459-2676\\nFU NSF [OCE-0744245, OCE-0960770, OCE-1026607, AGS-1048995]; Department of\\n   Energy [DE-SC0002000]; NOAA [ECPC: NA17RJ1231]; Directorate For\\n   Geosciences [1026607] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Div\\n   Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences [1048995] Funding Source: National\\n   Science Foundation; Division Of Ocean Sciences [0960770] Funding Source:\\n   National Science Foundation\\nFX This study forms a portion of the Ph.

The observed velocity and temperature fluctuations within the pycnocline reveal the presence of Kelvin waves including vertical energy propagation, energy equipartition, and nondispersive relationship. Two current meters at 750 and 1500m provide further evidence that the vertical structure of the downwelling Kelvin wave resembles that of the second baroclinic wave mode. The Kelvin waves derive their energy from the equatorial Indian Ocean winds, including those associated with the Madden-Julian oscillations, and propagate from Lombok Strait to Makassar Strait along the 100-m isobath. The northward propagating Kelvin waves within the pycnocline reduce the southward Makassar Strait throughflow by up to 2Sv and induce a marked increase of vertical diffusivity.\\nC1 [Pujiana, K.; Gordon, A.

The results reveal that most salinity maximum water in the North Atlantic comes from the northwestern part of the subtropical gyre, and direct contribution from the evaporation-precipitation maximum region via the surface Ekman current is minor. Water originating from the evaporation-precipitation maximum region has to recirculate in the subtropical gyre before entering the sea surface salinity maximum region from the northwest. Once subducted, some portion (similar to 10%) of the salinity maximum water enters the equatorial region in the shallow subtropical cell, but most (similar to 70%) of it appears to turn northward to join the North Atlantic Deep Water. The latter pathway involves a three-dimensional circulation. When the warm, fresh surface water flows northward along the western boundary, it turns eastward in the northern subtropical gyre. As a result of the large excess of evaporation over precipitation, this water gradually gains its salinity on the route, until it reaches the sea surface salinity maximum region in the central subtropical gyre. From there, the salinity maximum water is subducted and flows back to the western boundary in the depth range of the thermocline. With its high-salinity nature, a major portion of this water penetrates into the subpolar region and directly contributes to the deep thermohaline circulation.\\nC1 [Qu, Tangdong; Gao, Shan] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Int Pacific Res Ctr, SOEST, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.\\n   [Fukumori, Ichiro] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA USA.\\nRP Qu, TD (通讯作者)，Univ Hawaii Manoa, Int Pacific Res Ctr, SOEST, 1680 East West Rd, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.\\nEM tangdong@hawaii.edu\\nRI Fukumori, Ichiro/AAY-9005-2020; Gao, Shan/H-7959-2013\\nOI Fukumori, Ichiro/0000-0002-0882-6400; Gao, Shan/0000-0003-4510-5028\\nFU NASA\\nFX This research was supported by NASA as part of the Aquarius Science Team\\n   investigation.

Using a coupled hydrodynamic and biological model, we examine how tides, wind, surface waves, and light affect the fate of this effluent plume. The nearshore circulation and tidal flows constrain the freshwater plume to the surface. Winds can overcome both the stratification and ambient tidal advection to keep the plume to the west (away from major beaches) and mix the plume deeper into the water column. Surface waves due to swell act to mix the plume deep and keep the plume onshore. We find that the plume does not extend offshore in the presence of winds or waves. Using Enterococcus spp. as the bacterial agent, we find that residency is increased when mixed deeper away from the light. Comparing predicted Enterococcus spp. with in-situ samples for five distinct plume events, we find that the model accurately represents the observed bacterial concentrations when the Ala Wai is the primary source of Enterococcus spp. discharge. The results show that predictive models may be an invaluable complement to water quality sampling programs for regions of high human activity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigated dynamic height as a variable for identifying the spawning habitat of northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax), Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax), and jack mackerel (Trachurus symmetricus). During cruises between 1998 and 2004, dynamic height was calculated from temperature and salinity profiles, while fish egg concentration was measured with obliquely towed bongo nets and the Continuous, Underway Fish Egg Sampler. Dynamic height ranged between 68 and 108 cm, with values increasing offshore. The greatest probability of encountering anchovy, sardine, and jack mackerel eggs occurred at dynamic heights of 79-83 cm, 84-89 cm, and 89-99 cm, respectively. Four mechanisms were proposed to explain how dynamic height affects egg distribution: (1) dynamic height is a proxy for upper water column temperature and salinity, which are known to influence spawning habitat. (2) Low dynamic heights are indicative of coastal upwelling, which increases primary and secondary productivity. (3) Egg concentration is greater at dynamic heights coincident with geostrophic currents that transport larvae to favorable habitats. (4) Eddies delineated by dynamic height contours retain eggs in productive habitats. To evaluate these mechanisms, a generalized linear model was constructed using dynamic height, temperature, salinity, chlorophyll, zooplankton volume, geostrophic currents, and eddies as independent variables. Dynamic height explained more variance than any other variable in models of sardine and anchovy spawning habitat. Together temperature, salinity, and chlorophyll accounted for 80-95% of the dynamic height effect, emphasizing the importance of the first two mechanisms. However, dynamic height remained statistically significant in the models of anchovy and jack mackerel spawning habitat after considering the effects of all other variables. Dynamic height shows promise as an ecological indicator of spawning habitat, because it integrates the effects of multiple oceanic variables, can be remotely sensed, and is predicted by ocean circulation models.

This current flows almost along the isobaths, and it deflects from the isobaths veering toward deep water when flowing over the Dongsha Islands. Geographic currents derived from the climatologic hydrography data (WOA01) and absolute dynamic topography (ADT) data confirm the deflection of the northeastward current on NSCS continent. A fine resolution regional ocean model which can well reproduce the large scale circulation in the NSCS is used to analyze the dynamic about the deflection. The vorticity term balances shows that JEBAR (Joint Effect of Baroclinicity and Relief) drives the water column to depart from the isobaths. To the east of the Dongsha Islands, the isopycnal is almost orthogonal to the isobaths. The joint effect of the topographic and the baroclinic effect supplies negative vorticity and drives the water column to deflect from the isobaths and veer to deeper water. Momentum analysis along the stream line shows that, when the sea water flows around the Dongsha islands, the pressure gradient along the isobath pushes the sea water to accelerate, and then the Coriolis force orthogonal to the isobath increases and overcomes the corresponding pressure gradient, which drives the water deflected from the isobath toward the deep sea.

The spectral shape in the wavelength range of 70-250 km was approximated by a power law, representing a regime governed by geostrophic turbulence theories. The effects of altimeter instrument noise were assumed insignificant at wavelengths longer than 70 km. The authors reexamined the assumption in the study. Using nearly simultaneous observations made by Jason-1 and Jason-2 during their cross-calibration phase, this study found that the white noise level of altimetry measurement was best estimated from the spectral values at wavelengths from 25 to 35 km. After removing a white noise level based on such estimate from the SSH spectrum, the spectral slope values changed significantly over most of the oceans. A key finding is that the spectral slopes are generally steeper than k(-2) (k is wavenumber) poleward of the 20 degrees latitudes, where flatter spectral slopes in some regions have previously caused problems for dynamic interpretations. The new results indicate that the spectral slopes in the core regions of the major ocean current systems have values between the original geostrophic turbulence theory and the surface quasigeostrophic theory. The near k(-4) spectrum suggests that the sea surface height variability at these wavelengths in the high eddy energy regions might be governed by frontogenesis.\\nC1 [Xu, Yongsheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Key Lab Ocean Circulat & Waves, Qingdao, Peoples R China.\\n   [Fu, Lee-Lueng] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA USA.\\nRP Xu, YS (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Key Lab Ocean Circulat & Waves, Qingdao, Peoples R China.\\nEM yongsheng.xu@qdio.ac.cn\\nFU National Aeronautic and Space Administration; Jason-1; OSTM/Jason-2; CAS\\n   [Y22114101Q]; China 973 Project [2012CB956000]\\nFX The research presented in the paper was partly (LLF) carried out at the\\n   Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under\\n   contract with the National Aeronautic and Space Administration.

Using these algorithms, a merged multi-sensor time series of the surface Chl-a concentration in California Current region was created. The merged Oil-a time series (November 1996-December 2011) show a significant (P < 0.01) increasing trend off central California and significant (P < 0.01) decreasing trends in the central North Pacific gyre and off southern Baja California. Although this 15-year time series is too short to separate interannual and multidecadal cycles from climate trends, both of these trends are consistent with the predicted effects of global warming. The expected increase in vertical stratification of the water column and the resulting decreased vertical flux of nutrients would lead to lower Chl-a in the gyre but the increased upwelling-favorable winds leading to stronger upwelling off central California or the increased nitrate content of the upwelled water would lead to higher Chl-a in the upwelling region. The decreased Chl-a off southern Baja California resembles the effect of a decreased influence of strong El Nino events. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\\nC1 [Kahru, Mati; Mitchell, B.

A large meander (LM) in the path of the Kuroshio south of Japan develops and disappears in a highly bimodal fashion on decadal timescales. The modeled meander is comparable in timing and spatial extent to an observed feature in the region. Various characteristics of the LM are examined, including relative vorticity, transport, and velocity shear. The many similarities between the model and observations indicate that the meander results from intrinsic oceanic variability, which is represented in this climatologically forced model. Each LM is preceded by a smaller \"trigger\" meander that originates at the south end of Kyushu, moves up the coast, and develops into the LM. However, there are also many meanders very similar in character to the trigger meander that do not develop into LMs. Formation of an LM only occurs when a deep anticyclone associated with the trigger meander forms near Koshu Seamount. Furthermore, the major axis of that deep anticyclone must be oriented away from the coast, rather than alongshore. In the specific case of interaction of a trigger meander with a deep anticyclone with major axis oriented away from the coastline, LM formation occurs.\\nC1 [Douglass, Elizabeth M.; Jayne, Steven R.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\n   [Bryan, Frank O.; Peacock, Synte] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.\\n   [Maltrud, Mathew] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Los Alamos, NM USA.\\nRP Douglass, EM (通讯作者)，Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\nEM edouglass@whoi.edu\\nRI Bryan, Frank O/I-1309-2016\\nOI Bryan, Frank O/0000-0003-1672-8330; Jayne, Steven/0000-0001-7999-0147\\nFU Doherty Foundation; National Science Foundation [OCE-0849808]; National\\n   Center for Atmospheric Research; Division Of Ocean Sciences [0825152]\\n   Funding Source: National Science Foundation\\nFX E.M.D. acknowledges support of the Doherty Foundation and National\\n   Science Foundation OCE-0849808.

Processes and interpretations\\nSO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS\\nLA English\\nDT Article\\nID BARRIER LAYER; MIXED-LAYER; TRANSPORT; MONSOON; MODEL\\nAB The impacts of two consecutive, strong tropical cyclones (TCs) from October-November in 1999 on the Bay of Bengal (BoB) heat budget are examined using the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model. The model uses atmospheric conditions from reanalysis, reconstructed TC winds, and satellite-observed winds and precipitation. We conduct a series of diagnostic experiments to isolate the model\\'s response to the individual TC-associated forcings. During the TCs, the BoB ocean heat content (OHC) is reduced, primarily due to TC-wind induced southward ocean heat transport (OHT) and a reduction in surface downward radiation due to increased cloudiness. BoB OHC is largely restored in the following months via enhanced surface heat fluxes, associated with cold wake restoration, and positive northward OHT. The TCs\\' downward heat pumping effect is estimated to be similar to 1.74 x 10(18) J near the end of February 2000, which is less than estimates using previously published methods based on surface observations. The relatively weak heat pumping results from freshwater input by intense monsoon rainfall and river discharge in the BoB, which stabilizes stratification, forms a barrier layer, and generates temperature inversions during seasonal surface cooling. As a result, early stage TC winds entrain the warm barrier layer water and enhance enthalpy loss in the southeastern Bay, while mature stage TC winds erode the barrier layer, decrease SST through upwelling and entrainment of deeper cold water and reduce enthalpy loss in the northwestern Bay. Our findings suggest TC winds may significantly alter the interseasonal BoB heat budget through OHT and surface heat fluxes.\\nC1 [Wang, Jih-Wang; Han, Weiqing] Univ Colorado, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.\\n   [Sriver, Ryan L.] Univ Illinois, Dept Atmospher Sci, Urbana, IL USA.\\nRP Wang, JW (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, 311 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.\\nEM jihwang@colorado.edu\\nFU NSF [0847605]; NASA OSTST [NNX08AR62G]; NOAA [NA11OAR4310100]\\nFX We would like to thank Allan Wallcraft for HYCOM consultation, and\\n   anonymous reviewers for their constructing comments that helped to\\n   improve this manuscript.

These data were used to calibrate and evaluate the performance of a coupled hydrodynamic and wave model for the MCR based on the Delft3D modeling system. The MCR is a dynamic estuary inlet in which tidal currents, river discharge, and wave-driven currents are all important. Model tuning consisted primarily of spatial adjustments to bottom drag coefficients. In combination with (near-) default parameter settings, the MCR model application is able to simulate the dominant features in the tidal flow, salinity and wavefields observed in field measurements. The wave-orbital averaged method for representing the current velocity profile in the wave model is considered the most realistic for the MCR. The hydrodynamic model is particularly effective in reproducing the observed vertical residual and temporal variations in current structure. Density gradients introduce the observed and modeled reversal of the mean flow at the bed and augment mean and peak flow in the upper half of the water column. This implies that sediment transport during calmer summer conditions is controlled by density stratification and is likely net landward due to the reversal of flow near the bed. The correspondence between observed and modeled hydrodynamics makes this application a tool to investigate hydrodynamics and associated sediment transport.\\nC1 [Elias, Edwin P.

Recent advances in drilling technology and climate proxy methods have made it possible to retrieve and interpret high-quality ice-proximal sedimentary sequences from Antarctica\\'s margins and the Southern Ocean. These records contain a wealth of information about the individual histories of the East and West Antarctic Ice Sheets and associated temperature change in the circum-Antarctic seas. Emerging studies of Antarctic drill cores provide evidence of dynamic climate variability on both short and long timescales over the past 20 million years. This geologic information is critical for testing and improving computer model simulations used to predict future environmental change in the polar regions. Identifying the mechanistic links between past Antarctic ice-volume fluctuations and oceanographic change is necessary for understanding Earth\\'s long-term climate evolution. While recent successes highlight the value of ice-proximal records, additional scientific drilling and climate proxy development are required to improve current knowledge of Antarctica\\'s complex paleoenvironmental history.\\nC1 [Shevenell, Amelia E.] Univ S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA.\\n   [Bohaty, Steven M.] Univ Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr, Southampton, Hants, England.\\nRP Shevenell, AE (通讯作者)，Univ S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA.\\nEM ashevenell@usf.edu\\nRI Shevenell, Amelia/C-2757-2015; shevenell, Amelia/A-4161-2009\\nOI Shevenell, Amelia/0000-0002-6457-6530; \\nNR 86\\nTC 1\\nZ9 1\\nU1 0\\nU2 27\\nPU OCEANOGRAPHY SOC\\nPI ROCKVILLE\\nPA P.O.

During these episodes, oxygen can drop to physiologically stressful levels, and pH can reach values that potentially result in dissolution of calcium carbonate. Pulses of the greatest intensity arose at the onset of the spring upwelling season, and fluctuations were strongly semidiurnal and diurnal. Arrival of cold, hypoxic water on the inner shelf appears to be driven by tidal-frequency internal waves pushing deep, upwelled water into nearshore habitats. We found no relationship between the timing of low-oxygen events and the diel solar cycle. These observations are consistent with the interpretation that hypoxic water is advected shoreward from the deep, offshore environment where water masses experience a general decline of temperature, oxygen and pH with depth. Analysis of the durations of exposure to low oxygen concentrations establishes a framework for assessing the ecological relevance of these events, but physiological tolerance limits to such hypoxic events are not well documented for most near-shore organisms expected to be impacted.

This new climatology is based on individual profiles from the World Ocean Database 2009 and serial oceanographic observed data provided by Korea Ocean Data Center. We use an optimal interpolation method and employ a two step mapping technique to resolve both small- and large-scale climatological features. Potential vorticity constraint term is also included to consider the tendency of ocean currents following the bathymetry. From the scale sensitivity experiment using an independent observed data, we define optimal length scales for the new high resolution climatology in the southwestern East Sea (Japan Sea).

From 1972-2000, there was high interannual variability of areal extent of sea ice during spring (March-April). In 2000, this shifted to a 5-year (2001-2005) period of low ice extent during spring, which transitioned to a 4-year (2007-2010) period of extensive sea ice. High (low) areal extent of sea ice in spring was associated with cold (warm) water column temperatures for the following 6-7 months. The ocean currents also differed between warm and cold years. During cold years, the monthly-mean currents over the shelf were largely westward, while in warm years the direction of currents was more variable, with northward flow during December-February and relatively weak flow during the remainder of the year. The types and abundance of zooplankton differed sharply between warm and cold years. This was especially true during the prolonged warm period (2001-2005) and cold period (2007-2010), and was less evident during the years of high interannual variability. During the warm period, there was a lack of large copepods and euphausiids over the shelf; however, their populations rebounded during cold period. Small crustacean zooplankton taxa did not appear to vary between and warm and cold years. For both walleye pollock and Pacific cod, year-class strength (recruitment) was low during the prolonged warm period, but improved during the following cold period. Year-class strength did not appear to vary as a function of warm and cold years during the period of high year-to-year variability. Also, recruitment of arrowtooth flounder (a predator of pollock and cod) did not appear influenced by the warm or cold years. Finally, the distribution and relative abundance of fin whales appeared to differ in warm and cold years, with fewer whales on the southeastern, middle shelf during warm years. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Focus is placed on the case of a cold, freshwater layer above a warm, salty layer [i.e., the diffusive convection (DC) regime]. The \"diffusive interface\" between these layers will develop gravitationally unstable boundary layers due to the more rapid diffusion of heat (the destabilizing component) relative to salt. Previous studies have assumed that a purely convective-type instability of these boundary layers is what drives convection in this system and that this may be parameterized by a boundary layer Rayleigh number. The authors test this theory by conducting both a linear stability analysis and direct numerical simulations of a diffusive interface. Their linear stability analysis reveals that the transition to instability always occurs as an oscillating diffusive convection mode and at boundary layer Rayleigh numbers much smaller than previously thought. However, these findings are based on making a quasi-steady assumption for the growth of the interfaces by molecular diffusion. When diffusing interfaces are modeled (using direct numerical simulations), the authors observe that the time dependence is significant in determining the instability of the boundary layers and that the breakdown is due to a purely convective-type instability. Their findings therefore demonstrate that the relevant instability in a DC staircase is purely convective.\\nC1 [Carpenter, J.

If the bottom Ekman transport vanishes and there are no interior stresses, then steady linear flow on an f plane must be geostrophic and follow isobaths exactly. The influence of arrest on cross-shelf transport is investigated here to establish 1) whether there are substantial penetration asymmetries between cases with upwelling and downwelling in the bottom boundary layer; 2) over what spatial scales, hence in what parameter regime, buoyancy arrest is important; and 3) the effects of depth-dependent interior flow. The problem is approached using scalings and idealized numerical models. The results show that there is little or no asymmetry introduced by bottom boundary layer behavior. Further, if the stratification is weak or moderate, as measured by a slope Burger number s = alpha N/f (where alpha is the bottom slope, N is buoyancy frequency, and f is the Coriolis parameter), buoyancy arrest does not exert a strong constraint on cross-isobath exchange.\\nC1 Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Phys Oceanog, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\nRP Brink, KH (通讯作者)，Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Phys Oceanog, Mail Stop 21, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\nEM kbrink@whoi.edu\\nFU National Science Foundation [OCE-0849498]\\nFX Thoughtful comments by Steve Lentz and two anonymous reviewers are\\n   gratefully acknowledged.

The modulations are shown to be consistent with an advecting passive tracer in turbulent flow, leading to the physical mechanism for this signature being turbulent eddies in the flow. The intensity modulations are hypothesized to be light scattered from variations in the sediment load being transported by these turbulent eddies, although other imaging mechanisms such as surface roughness variations may be occurring as well. Supporting evidence is the prevalence of the signature in sediment-laden, nearshore flows along an exposed coast and through a tidal inlet and eddy-like variations in the echo intensity of acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs). Also, the 3-D frequency-wave number spectrum of mapped image sequence data exhibits a classic shape that is consistent with surface turbulence generation by boils and subsequent mixing and advection by eddies in shallow channels. The velocity vector is retrieved by the geometry obtained in the least squares fit of a 2-D planar surface representing advective variance in the 3-D spectrum. These retrievals agree within 15 cm/s root-mean-square (RMS) with concurrent ADCP measurements and within 2 cm/s RMS of measurements of the Doppler shift of surface gravity waves that also are present in the data.

Instead, they spend a portion of their lives as tiny larvae in the overlying water column. Dispersal of larvae among vent sites is critical for population maintenance, colonization of new vents, and recolonization of disturbed vents. Historically, studying larvae has been challenging, especially in the deep sea. Advances in the last decade in larval culturing technologies and more integrated, interdisciplinary time-series observations are providing new insights into how hydrothermal vent animals use the water column to maintain their populations across ephemeral and disjunct habitats. Larval physiology and development are often constrained by evolutionary history, resulting in larvae using a diverse set of dispersal strategies to interact with the surrounding currents at different depths. These complex biological and oceanographic interactions translate the reproductive output of adults in vent communities into a dynamic supply of settling larvae from sources near and far.\\nC1 [Adams, Diane K.; Arellano, Shawn M.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Biol, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\n   [Govenar, Breea] Rhode Isl Coll, Providence, RI 02908 USA.\\nRP Adams, DK (通讯作者)，Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Biol, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\nEM dadams@whoi.edu\\nRI Adams, Diane/E-7831-2015; Arellano, Shawn Michelle/A-3960-2013; Govenar,\\n   Breea/AAZ-9676-2020\\nOI Adams, Diane/0000-0001-6638-5781; Arellano, Shawn\\n   Michelle/0000-0002-9775-214X; \\nFU Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution\\nFX All authors contributed equally to the manuscript.

It is found that both NAO and ENSO have impacts on Great Lakes ice cover. The Great Lakes tend to have lower (higher) ice cover during the positive (negative) NAO. El Nino events are often associated with lower ice cover. The influence of La Nina on Great Lakes ice cover is intensity-dependent: strong (weak) La Nina events are often associated with lower (higher) ice cover. The interference of impacts of ENSO and NAO complicates the relationship between ice cover and either of them. The nonlinear effects of ENSO on Great Lakes ice cover are important in addition to NAO effects. The correlation coefficient between the quadratic Nino3.4 index and ice cover (-0.48) becomes significant at the 99% confidence level. The nonlinear response of Great Lakes ice cover to ENSO is mainly due to the phase shift of the teleconnection patterns during the opposite phases of ENSO. Multiple-variable nonlinear regression models were developed for ice coverage. Using the quadratic Nino3.4 index instead of the index itself can significantly improve the prediction of Great Lakes ice cover (the correlation between the modeled and observed increases from 0.35 to 0.51). Including the interactive term NAO center dot Nino3.4(2) further improves the prediction skill (the correlation increases from 0.51 to 0.59). The analysis is also applied to individual lakes. The model for Lake Michigan has the highest prediction skill, while Lake Erie has the smallest skill.\\nC1 [Bai, Xuezhi; Assel, Raymond] Univ Michigan, Cooperat Inst Limnol & Ecosyst Res, Ann Arbor, MI 48108 USA.\\n   [Wang, Jia; Clites, Anne; Assel, Raymond] NOAA, Great Lakes Environm Res Lab, Ann Arbor, MI 48108 USA.\\n   [Sellinger, Cynthia] Oregon State Univ, Coll Oceans & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.\\nRP Bai, XZ (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Cooperat Inst Limnol & Ecosyst Res, 4840 S State Rd, Ann Arbor, MI 48108 USA.\\nEM jia.wang@noaa.gov\\nOI Wang, Jia/0000-0003-4154-9721\\nFU National Research Council; NOAA GLERL; EPA/NOAA Great Lakes Restoration\\n   Initiative\\nFX The NOAA/OAR/ESRL PSD, Boulder, Colorado, USA, provided NCEP reanalysis\\n   data, from their Web site at http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/.

These studies provide important insights into magmatic systems and hydrothermal flow in these regions, with broader implications for fast- and intermediate-spreading mid-ocean ridges. A mid-crust magma body is imaged beneath Endeavour Segment underlying all known vent fields, suggesting that prior notions of a tectonically driven hydrothermal system at this site can be ruled out. There is evidence at both sites that the axial magma body is segmented on a similar 5-20 km length scale, with implications for the geometry of high-temperature axial hydrothermal flow and for lava geochemistry. The new data provide the first seismic reflection images of magma sills in the crust away from the axial melt lens. These off-axis magma reservoirs are the likely source of more-evolved lavas typically sampled on the ridge flanks and may be associated with off-axis hydrothermal venting, which has recently been discovered within the EPR site. Clusters of seismic reflection events at the base of the crust are observed, and localized regions of thick Moho Transition Zone, with frozen or partially molten gabbro lenses embedded within mantle rocks, are inferred. Studies of the upper crust on the flanks of Endeavour Segment provide new insights into the low-temperature hydrothermal flow that continues long after crustal formation. Precipitation of alteration minerals due to fluid flow leads to changes in P-wave velocities within seismic Layer 2A (the uppermost layer of the oceanic crust) that vary markedly with extent of sediment blanketing the crust. In addition, intermediate-scale variations in the structure of Layers 2A and 2B with local topography are observed that may result from topographically driven fluid upflow and downflow on the ridge flanks.\\nC1 [Carbotte, Suzanne M.; Nedimovic, Mladen R.; Carton, Helene] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY USA.\\n   [Canales, Juan Pablo] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Geol & Geophys, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\n   [Nedimovic, Mladen R.] Dalhousie Univ, Halifax, NS, Canada.\\nRP Carbotte, SM (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY USA.\\nEM carbotte@ldeo.columbia.edu\\nRI Nedimovic, Mladen/B-8459-2009; Carton, Helene D/N-9417-2017; Nedimovic,\\n   Mladen/Q-6865-2019\\nOI Nedimovic, Mladen/0000-0003-0327-5192; Canales, Juan\\n   Pablo/0000-0003-3066-7888\\nFU NSF OCE [0002488, 0002551, 0648303, 0648923, 0327872, 0327885]\\nFX Thanks to Guest Editor Dan Fornari, William Wilcock, and two anonymous\\n   reviewers for their careful reviews, which improved the manuscript.

In areas covered by the Seasat orbit (to 72.16 degrees S), regional-averaged 30-year trends were negative (surface lowering), with rates between -0.03 and -0.16 m a(-1). Surface lowering preceded the start of near-continuous radar altimeter operations that began with ERS-1 in 1992. The average rate of lowering for the first 14 years of the period was typically smaller than the 30-year average; the exception was the southern Wilkins Ice Shelf, which experienced negligible lowering between 2000 and 2008, when a series of large calving events began. Analyses of the continuous ERS/Envisat time series (to 81.5 degrees) for 1992-2008 reveal a period of strong negative dhi/dt on most ice shelves between 1992 and 1995. Based on prior studies of regional atmospheric and oceanic conditions, we hypothesize that the observed elevation changes on Larsen C Ice Shelf are driven primarily by firn compaction while the western AP ice shelves are responding to changes in both surface mass balance and basal melt rates. Our time series also show that large changes in dh(i)/dt can occur on interannual time scales, reinforcing the importance of long time series altimetry to separate long-term trends associated with climate change from interannual to interdecadal natural variability.\\nC1 [Fricker, Helen Amanda] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Inst Geophys & Planetary Phys, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.\\n   [Padman, Laurie] Earth & Space Res, Corvallis, OR 97333 USA.\\nRP Fricker, HA (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Inst Geophys & Planetary Phys, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.\\nEM hafricker@ucsd.edu\\nRI Padman, Laurence/AAH-3808-2021\\nOI Fricker, Helen Amanda/0000-0002-0921-1432; Padman,\\n   Laurence/0000-0003-2010-642X\\nFU NASA [NNX06AD40G, NNX10AG19G]\\nFX We thank Jay Zwally\\'s Ice Altimetry group at the NASA Goddard Space\\n   Flight Center for processing, archiving and distributing their RA data\\n   sets for all satellite radar altimeter missions (see\\n   http://icesat4.gsfc.nasa.gov); Jairo Santana and Helen (Blue) Cornejo\\n   were particularly helpful as we delved deep into the data sets.

Both observations and the state estimate show layers distinguished by the temperature and salinity variability along isopycnals (i.e., spice variance). Mesoscale and submesoscale spice variance is largest in the remnant mixed layer, decreases to a minimum below the pycnocline near 26.3 kg m(-3), and then increases again near 26.6 kg m(-3). Layers of high (low) meso-and submesoscale spice variance are found on isopycnals where large-scale spice gradients are large (small), consistent with stirring of large-scale gradients to produce smaller scale thermohaline structure. Passive tracer adjoint calculations in the state estimate are used to investigate possible mechanisms for the formation of the layers of spice variance. Layers of high spice variance are found to have distinct origins and to be associated with named water masses; high spice variance water in the remnant mixed layer has northerly origin and is identified as Pacific Subarctic water, while the water in the deeper high spice variance layer has southerly origin and is identified as Equatorial Pacific water. The layer of low spice variance near 26.3 kg m(-3) lies between the named water masses and does not have a clear origin. Both effective horizontal diffusivity, kappa(h), and effective diapycnal diffusivity, kappa(v), are elevated relative to the diffusion coefficients set in the numerical simulation, but changes in kappa(h) and kappa(v) with depth are not sufficient to explain the observed layering of thermohaline structure.\\nC1 [Todd, Robert E.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\n   [Rudnick, Daniel L.; Mazloff, Matthew R.; Cornuelle, Bruce D.; Davis, Russ E.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.\\nRP Todd, RE (通讯作者)，Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, 266 Woods Hole Rd,MS 21, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\nEM rtodd@whoi.edu; drudnick@ucsd.edu; mmazloff@ucsd.edu;\\n   bcornuelle@ucsd.edu; rdavis@ucsd.edu\\nRI Mazloff, Matthew/AAG-6463-2019; Rudnick, Daniel L/J-8948-2016; Todd,\\n   Robert E/T-3536-2018\\nOI Mazloff, Matthew/0000-0002-1650-5850; Rudnick, Daniel\\n   L/0000-0002-2624-7074; Todd, Robert E/0000-0002-6854-7729; Cornuelle,\\n   Bruce/0000-0003-2110-3319; Davis, Russ/0000-0003-1903-6313\\nFU Instrument Development Group at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography;\\n   Southern California Coastal Ocean Observing System (SCCOOS); Gordon and\\n   Betty Moore Foundation; Coastal Ocean Currents Monitoring Project\\n   (COCMP); NOAA; Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; Cooperative\\n   Institute for the North Atlantic Region\\nFX Spray glider observations were supported by the Instrument Development\\n   Group at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the Southern\\n   California Coastal Ocean Observing System (SCCOOS).

FVCOM captures the near-resonant nature of the semidiurnal tide and energy flux in the GoM and the complex dynamics governing the tide in the NES. Stratification has limited impact on tidal elevation, but can significantly modify the tidal current profile. Internal tides are energetic in the stratified regions over steep bottom topography, but their contribution to the total tidal energy flux is only significant over the northeast flank of Georges Bank. The model suggests that the tidal flushing-induced eddy east of Monomoy Island is the dynamic basis for the locally observed phase lead of the M-2 tide. The southward propagating tidal wave east of Cape Cod encounters the northeastward propagating tidal wave from the NES south of Nantucket Island, forming a zone of minimum sea level along a southeast-oriented line from Nantucket Island. These two waves are characterized by linear dynamics in which bottom friction and advection are negligible in the momentum balance, but their superposition leads to a strong nonlinear current interaction and large bottom stress in the zone of lowest sea elevation.\\nC1 [Chen, Changsheng; Xu, Qichun; Cowles, Geoffrey W.; Sun, Yunfang; Qi, Jianhua; Lin, Huichan] Univ Massachusetts Dartmouth, Sch Marine Sci & Technol, New Bedford, MA 02744 USA.\\n   [Chen, Changsheng] Shanghai Ocean Univ, Marine Ecosyst & Environm Lab, Coll Marine Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China.\\n   [Huang, Haosheng] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Sch Coast & Environm, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.\\n   [Beardsley, Robert C.; Limeburner, Richard] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Phys Oceanog, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\nRP Chen, CS (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts Dartmouth, Sch Marine Sci & Technol, New Bedford, MA 02744 USA.\\nEM c1chen@umassd.edu; hhuang7@lsu.edu; rbeardsley@whoi.edu; qxu@umassd.edu;\\n   rlimeburner@whoi.edu; gcowles@umassd.edu\\nRI Sun, Yunfang/J-1859-2015\\nOI Sun, Yunfang/0000-0001-6656-2581\\nFU NSF [OCE-0234545, 0227679, 0606928, 0726851, 0814505, OCE-02-27679]; MIT\\n   Sea Grant College Program, under NOAA [NA06OAR4170019]; MIT SG project\\n   [2006-R/RC-103, 2006-R/RC-102, 2006-R/RC-107, 2008-R/RC-107]; NOAA\\n   NERACOOS; Shanghai Ocean University [A-2302-11-0003]; Science and\\n   Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality [09320503700]; Shanghai\\n   Municipal Education Commission [J50702]; State Key Laboratory for\\n   Estuarine and Coastal Research; East China Normal University (ECNU);\\n   NOAA [DOC/NOAA/NA04NMF4720332, DOC/NOAA/NA05NMF4721131]; \\n   [2010-R/RC-116]\\nFX This research is supported by the U.S. GLOBEC Northwest Atlantic/Georges\\n   Bank Program NSF (OCE-0234545, 0227679, 0606928, 0726851 and 0814505) to\\n   Changsheng Chen and Qixchun Xu and NSF grant (OCE-02-27679) and the WHOI\\n   Smith Chair to Robert Beardsley and Richard Limeburner.

In this study, we test the hypothesis that mesoscale spatial organization of krill is related to oceanographic conditions associated with coastal upwelling. To test this, we compiled a climatology of krill distributions based on hydroacoustic surveys off California in May-June each year between 2000 and 2009 (missing 2007). Approximately 53,000 km of ocean habitat was sampled, resulting in a comprehensive geo-spatial data set from the Southern California Bight to Cape Mendocino. We determined the location and characteristics of eight definite and two probable krill \"hotspots\" of abundance. Directional-dependence analysis revealed that krill hotspots were oriented in a northwest-southeast (135 degrees) direction, corresponding to the anisotropy of the 200-2000 m isobath. Krill hotspots were disassociated (inversely correlated) with three upwelling centers, Point Arena, Point Sur, and Point Conception, suggesting that krill may avoid locations of strong offshore transport or aggregate downstream from these locations. While current fisheries management considers the entire coast out to the 2000 m isobath critical habitat for krill in this ecosystem, we establish here smaller scale structuring of this critical mid-trophic level prey resource. Identifying mesoscale krill hotspots and their oceanographic determinants is significant as these smaller ecosystem divisions may warrant protection to ensure key ecosystem functions (i.e., trophic transfer) and resilience. Furthermore, delineating and quantifying krill hotspots may be important for conservation of krill-predators in this system. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The data were used in an offline mode to evolve adjoint pathways of a passive tracer, which is injected from the key channels of the Indonesian straits where the ITF enters into the Indian Ocean. The adjoint pathways are simulated using interannually varying circulations for 41 yr starting from December 2000 to January 1960 with reversed currents and other physical parameters (control run). A climatological run for the 41 yr is produced with the reversed currents and other physical parameters as a monthly climatology. The adjoint pathway variability is found by subtracting the climatological run from the control run. The empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis carried out over the monthly differences between the tracer concentrations of the control run and the climatological run shows that the ITF is largely supplied from the northwestern tropical Pacific during a normal year, whereas the supply from the south equatorial Pacific is dominant during El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) years at a lag of 6 months. The interannual variability of the ITF source water pathways in the Pacific is largely determined by the ENSO variability and they are confined to the tropical Pacific, whereas the corresponding interdecadal variability is controlled by the meridional overturning circulations in the tropical and subtropical Pacific. The adjoint pathways hint that the ITF volume transport may have interdecadal variability; they are closely related to the variability of the subtropical cells (STCs) in the Pacific Ocean and can be quantified using the tropical convergence changes. The ITF is just an active member of the recharge discharge of tropical warm waters at all time scales, and its role in the coupled climate variability of the Indo-Pacific needs to be assessed in that context.\\nC1 [Valsala, Vinu; Maksyutov, Shamil] Natl Inst Environm Studies, CGER, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.\\n   [Murtugudde, Raghu] Univ Maryland, ESSIC, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.\\nRP Valsala, V (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Trop Meteorol, CAT ESSC, Pune 411008, Maharashtra, India.\\nEM valsala@tropmet.res.in\\nRI , Nobody/M-9571-2019; Valsala, Vinu/V-8414-2019; Maksyutov, Shamil\\n   S/G-6494-2011\\nOI Maksyutov, Shamil S/0000-0002-1200-9577\\nFU CGER, NIES; NASA\\nFX The authors are thankful for the financial support from GOSAT project of\\n   CGER, NIES.

The model included water and sediment discharge from the Mississippi River and Atchafalaya Bay, seabed resuspension, and suspended transport by currents. Input wave properties were provided by the Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN) model so that ROMS could estimate wave-driven bed stresses, critical to shallow-water sediment suspension. The model used temporally variable but spatially uniform winds, spatially variable seabed grain size distributions, and six sediment tracers from rivers and seabed.\\n   At the end of the year 1993, much of the modeled fluvial sediment accumulation was localized with deposition focused near sediment sources. Mississippi sediment remained within 20-40 km of the Mississippi Delta. Most Atchafalaya sediment remained landward of the 10-m isobath in the innermost shelf south of Atchafalaya Bay. Atchafalaya sediment displayed an elongated westward dispersal pattern toward the Chenier Plain, reflecting the importance of wave resuspension and perennially westward depth-averaged currents in the shallow waters (< 10 m). Due to relatively high settling velocities assumed for sediment from the Mississippi River as well as the shallowness of the shelf south of Atchafalaya Bay, most sediment traveled only a short distance before initial deposition. Little fluvial sediment could be transported into the vicinity of the \"Dead Zone\" (low-oxygen area) within a seasonal-annual timeframe. Near the Mississippi Delta and Atchafalaya Bay, alongshore sediment-transport fluxes always exceeded cross-shore fluxes. Estimated cumulative sediment fluxes next to Atchafalaya Bay were episodic and \"stepwise-like\" compared to the relatively gradual transport around the Mississippi Delta. During a large storm in March 1993, strong winds helped vertically mix the water column over the entire shelf (up to 100-m isobath), and wave shear stress dominated total bed stress. During fair-weather conditions in May 1993, however, the freshwater plumes spread onto a stratified water column, and combined wave-current shear stress only exceeded the threshold for suspending sediment in the inner-most part of the shelf.

During this time period, Amundsen Gulf was a dynamic sea ice environment composed primarily of first year ice with open water coverage varying between 1-14%. In all cases where measurements were influenced by open water we measured CO2 fluxes that were 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than those expected under similar conditions in the open ocean. Fluxes were typically directed toward the water surface with a mean flux of -4.88 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and a maximum of -27.95 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). One case of rapid outgassing (mean value +2.10 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) was also observed. The consistent patten of enhanced gas exchange over open water allows us to hypothesize that high water-side turbulence is the main cause of these events. Modification of the physical and chemical properties of the surface seawater by cooling and brine rejection may also play a role. A rough calculation using an estimate of open water coverage suggests that the contribution of these events to the annual regional air-sea CO2 exchange budget may make the winter months as important as the open water months. Although high, the uptake of CO2 fits within mixed layer dissolved inorganic carbon budgets derived for the region by other investigators.\\nC1 [Else, B. G. T.; Papakyriakou, T. N.; Galley, R.

Average daily CO2 flux calculated from the pCO(2) and gas transfer coefficients ranged from -0.144 to -0.0701 g C m(-2) day(-1) depending on which gas transfer coefficient was used. The pCO(2) before the landfast ice sheets melted appeared to be highly biologically controlled based on the following information: (1) the diurnal pattern of pCO(2) was strongly correlated with Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density (PPFD); (2) high chlorophyll density was observed during periods of peak uptake; and (3) the day-to-day variation in the pCO(2) strongly correlated with the presence or absence of near-shore ice sheets. The lowest pCO(2) of 35 ppm together with the highest PPFD of 1362 mu mol E m(-2) s(-1) observed in the afternoon on June 28 in the presence of sea ice. The very low pCO(2) observed in late June was likely caused by high photosynthetic rates related to high phytoplankton densities typically observed from spring to early summer near the ice edge, and by water low in salinity and CO2 released by melting sea ice early in the season.

Dividing flux by the concurrent air-sea concentration difference yields the transfer velocity of DMS (k(DMS)). The k(DMS) in the Southern Ocean was significantly lower than previous measurements in the equatorial east Pacific, Sargasso Sea, northeast Atlantic, and southeast Pacific. Normalizing k(DMS) for the temperature dependence in waterside diffusivity and solubility results in better agreement among various field studies and suggests that the low k(DMS) in the Southern Ocean is primarily due to colder temperatures. The higher solubility of DMS at a lower temperature results in greater airside control and less transfer of the gas by bubbles formed from breaking waves. The final normalized DMS transfer velocity is similar to k of less soluble gases such as carbon dioxide in low-to-moderate winds; in high winds, DMS transfer velocity is significantly lower because of the reduced bubble-mediated transfer.\\nC1 [Yang, M.; Blomquist, B.

They represent extreme statistical events,with wave-heights exceeding twice the significant wave height. The authors investigated a wave buoy data set collected off the US West Coast with 7,157 rogue waves observed over a total of 81 years. It yields comprehensive statistics regarding the likelihood of rogue wave occurrence in the open ocean, coastal ocean, and shallow water. The highest recorded rogue wave had a trough-to-crest height of 18.95 m. The average likelihood of occurrence is 63 per year in coastal waters and 101 per year in the open ocean. An extrapolation to conditions in the world ocean yields an average likelihood of encountering rogue waves along the main shipping routes in the North Atlantic of 0.8-1.2% per, day-for rogue waves exceeding 11 m in height. The results can be used to test rogue wave forecasting models and will help to improve the forecasting of hazardous ocean conditions.\\nC1 [Baschek, Burkard] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.\\n   [Imai, Jennifer] Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Phys & Astron, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA.\\nRP Baschek, B (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.\\nEM baschek@atmos.ucla.edu\\nFU Physical Sciences at the University of California at Los Angeles; US\\n   Army Corps of Engineers; California Department of Boating and Waterways\\nFX This study has been supported by start-up funds for B.

Observations of the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) in surface waters from August 2007 to May 2010 from ships and a buoy were used with historical data to produce a composite seasonal cycle for the central Oregon midshelf. These data indicate that the region is highly variable, at times being either a sink or strong source for atmospheric CO2. Interannual wind variability was an important determining factor in shaping the sink/source nature of this system. Late summer and early autumn was most variable relative to the rest of the year. Winter pCO(2) was near or slightly below atmospheric levels. Strong shelf-wide undersaturated conditions were first observed in early spring and lasted until the upwelling season became developed. Peak upwelling season pCO(2) ranged from <200 mu atm to >1000 mu atm. In July 2008, ship and buoy data revealed previously unobserved high-pCO(2) waters (similar to 1000 mu atm) at the surface. These conditions persisted for nearly 2 months and drove this system to be only a weak net annual atmospheric CO2 sink of -0.3 +/- 6.8 mol m(-2) yr(-1). These data showed, for the first time, the seasonal cycle of surface ocean pCO(2) on the central Oregon midshelf and the impact of heretofore undocumented pCO(2) levels on an estimate of sea-air CO2 flux for this region.\\nC1 [Evans, Wiley; Hales, Burke] Oregon State Univ, Coll Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.\\n   [Strutton, Peter G.] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.\\nRP Evans, W (通讯作者)，Oregon State Univ, Coll Ocean & Atmospher Sci, 104 Ocean Admin Bldg, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.\\nEM wevans@coas.oregonstate.edu\\nRI Strutton, Peter G/C-4466-2011; Evans, Wiley/U-8250-2018\\nOI Strutton, Peter G/0000-0002-2395-9471; Evans, Wiley/0000-0002-5450-0903\\nFU NSF [OCE-0752576]; Directorate For Geosciences [0836807] Funding Source:\\n   National Science Foundation\\nFX We thank the crews of the OSU R/V Wecoma and R/V Elakha and of the NOAA\\n   ships McArthur II and Miller Freeman.

The study period is June-October 2005, featuring intensive separation of the coastal upwelling jets in the eddy-dominated coastal transition zone (CTZ). The data assimilation (DA) system combines the nonlinear Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) and the Advanced Variational Regional Ocean Representer Analyzer (AVRORA) tangent linear and adjoint codes developed by our group. The variational representer DA method is implemented in a series of 6 day time windows, with initial conditions corrected at the beginning of each window. To avoid the problem of matching the model and observed SSH mean levels, the observed SSH slope has been assimilated. Location, timing, and intensity of jets and eddies in the CTZ are constrained, to improve accuracy of nonlinear model analyses and forecasts. In the case assimilating SSH alone, the geometry of the SST front is improved. SSH assimilation results in the cross-shore transport more uniformly distributed along the coast than in the free run model. An outer front is identified in the DA analyses at a distance of 200 km from the coast. A strong subsurface horizontal temperature gradient across this front influences the depth of the thermocline in an area between the front and the continental slope. The DA correction term is comparable in magnitude to dominant terms in the volume-integrated heat equation. The time-averaged DA correction term in the volume-integrated heat balance is closer to 0 in the combined SSH-SST assimilation case, than in the case assimilating SSH alone.\\nC1 [Kurapov, A.

This poses a challenge to any surf zone model to accurately resolve all relevant scales. One approach to sidestep this issue is to use a short-wave-averaged model, where fast-scale wave effects are included as forcing terms for the mean current. This is in contrast to Boussinesq wave-resolving models, where each individual wave is resolved along with any ambient current. In general, these two models will predict different current fields for the same wave and bathymetric input and therefore predict different mixing behavior of the flow. Using Lagrangian methods, we compare wave-averaged and wave-resolving model results to data from the RCEX experiment, which mapped the rip current circulation over a rip-channeled bathymetry using nearshore surface drifters. Absolute and pair dispersion estimates, including the finite size Lyapunov exponent, based on virtual trajectories are shown to be consistent with field observations, except for scales less than 5 m, where field drifters predict greater pair dispersion than both models because of either unresolved subgrid processes or GPS error. A simple Lagrangian stochastic model is able to reproduce some of this short time and length scale diffusivity found in the observational data.\\nC1 [Geiman, J. D.; Kirby, J.

The regional coupled model features a realistic representation of equatorial ocean dynamical processes such as the tropical instability waves (TIWs) that are not adequately simulated in many global coupled climate models. The coupled downscaling hence provides a unique opportunity to assess their response and impact in a changing climate. Under global warming, both global and regional models exhibit an increased (decreased) rainfall in the tropical northeast (South) Atlantic. Given this asymmetric change in mean state, the regional model produces the intensified near-surface cross-equatorial southerly wind and zonal currents. The equatorial cold tongue exhibits a reduced surface warming due to the enhanced upwelling. It is mainly associated with the increased vertical velocities driven by cross-equatorial wind, in contrast to the equatorial Pacific, where thermal stratification is suggested to be more important under global warming. The strengthened upwelling and zonal currents in turn amplify the dynamic instability of the equatorial ocean, thereby intensifying TIWs. The increased eddy heat flux significantly warms the equator and counters the effect of enhanced upwelling. Zonal eddy heat flux makes the largest contribution, suggesting a need for sustained monitoring of TIWs with spatially denser observational arrays in the equatorial oceans. Overall, results suggest that eddy heat flux is an important factor that may impact the mean state warming of equatorial oceans, as it does in the current climate.\\nC1 [Seo, Hyodae] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Phys Oceanog, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\n   [Seo, Hyodae; Xie, Shang-Ping] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Int Pacific Res Ctr, SOEST, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.\\nRP Seo, H (通讯作者)，Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Phys Oceanog, 266 Woods Hole Rd,Mail Stop 21, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\nEM hseo@whoi.edu\\nRI Seo, Hyodae/AAL-4263-2021; Xie, Shang-Ping/C-1254-2009\\nOI Seo, Hyodae/0000-0002-4352-5080; Xie, Shang-Ping/0000-0002-3676-1325\\nFU NOAA Climate and Global Change Postdoctoral Fellowship; Penzance Endowed\\n   Fund; NOAA; NSF; Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology\\nFX H.S. acknowledges the support from the NOAA Climate and Global Change\\n   Postdoctoral Fellowship Program and the Penzance Endowed Fund in Support\\n   of Assistant Scientists at WHOI.

We compared diatom-diazotroph assemblage (DDA) abundance to size-fractionated chlorophyll (chl) and satellite ocean color chlorophyll estimates to evaluate how DDAs affected ocean color estimates in the eastern and central North Pacific gyre at 28-30 degrees N. DDA blooms were dominated by either Hemiaulus hauckii (in the central Pacific in 2003 and the eastern Pacific in 2002) or by Rhizosolenia (eastern Pacific in 2002), both with nitrogen-fixing Richelia symbionts. The 2002 DDA bloom was measured a week prior to the development of a satellite-observed chlorophyll bloom at the same location. In contrast, the 2003 Hemiaulus bloom was not within a clearly defined satellite feature. Although DDA abundance increased 10(4)-10(5)-fold relative to the background and they dominated the net plankton (>= 5 mu m or > 10 mu m chl size) fraction, the in situ chl (maximum <= 0.11 mg m(-3)) never reached the 0.15 mg m(-3) threshold used to define satellite-observed chlorophyll blooms in oligotrophic waters. The DDA blooms were not evident in the in situ fluorometer data; however, the blooms occurred within high beam attenuation features observed in the transmissometer data. Trichodesmium was not a component of either diatom bloom although elevated levels of Trichodesmium were observed at two stations where DDAs were not abundant. While DDA blooms and satellite ocean chlorophyll blooms are sometimes coincident, our data do not support that DDAs are the sole source of the satellite-observed chlorophyll in summertime blooms. DDA blooms are likely underreported in the North Pacific, particularly in the waters west of Hawaii, due to their frequent lack of distinctive ocean color, fluorescence, and chlorophyll signatures. The source of the ocean color signature in the blooms remains elusive, but scattered literature observations suggest that cooccurring members of the near-surface flora such as the small pennate diatom Mastogloia may play an important role.\\nC1 [Villareal, Tracy A.; Schoenbaechler, Caimee A.] Univ Texas Austin, Inst Marine Sci, Port Aransas, TX 78373 USA.\\n   [Adornato, Lori] SRI Int, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA.\\n   [Wilson, Cara] NOAA NMFS, SW Fisheries Sci Ctr, Div Environm Res, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA.\\nRP Villareal, TA (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Inst Marine Sci, 750 Channel View Dr, Port Aransas, TX 78373 USA.\\nEM t.villareal@mail.utexas.edu\\nRI Villareal, Tracy A/I-9462-2012; Wilson, Cara/A-8816-2009\\nOI Villareal, Tracy A/0000-0002-5717-8163; Wilson, Cara/0000-0001-9318-2322\\nFU NSF [OCE-0099015]\\nFX This project was supported by NSF OCE-0099015 (T.

These results have been used to determine the partial molal volumes and compressibilities of transition metal ions (Mn(2+), Co(2+), Ni(2+), Cu(2+), Zn(2+) and Cd(2+)). These results and our earlier measurements (Me(2+), Ca(2+), Sr(2+) and Ba(2+)) were used to develop correlations between the values in water and NaCl. These correlations were used to predict the values of other divalent ions in water and NaCl (Be(2+), Pb(2+), He(2+) and Fe(2+)) that were difficult to directly measure. These studies allow one to make estimates of the effect of pressure on the activity coefficients of these ions in seawater and ionic equilibria in the deep oceans. The lower stability constants will result in increased concentrations of free transition metals in the deep ocean. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Eddy kinetic energy (EKE) in this region appears stronger in 2000-2004 and weaker in 1993-1996, 1998-2000, and 2007. It is found that this interannual modulation of EKE is mediated by the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), with a positive (negative) SAM corresponding to weak (strong) eddy activity in this region. The interannual modulation of the EKE by the SAM is through modulating the baroclinic instability associated with the surface-intensified South Indian Countercurrent (SICC) and the underlying South Equator Current (SEC) system. In the positive phase of the SAM, the southeastern subtropical Indian Ocean is dominated by an anomalous Ekman upwelling, which slackens the southward tilt of the isotherms and thus reduces the SICC. This shall reduce the vertical velocity shear of the SICC-SEC current system, leading to a weak instability and thus a weak eddy activity.\\nC1 [Jia, Fan; Wu, Lixin; Lan, Jian] Ocean Univ China, Phys Oceanog Lab, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China.\\n   [Qiu, Bo] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Oceanog, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.\\nRP Jia, F (通讯作者)，Ocean Univ China, Phys Oceanog Lab, 238 Songling Rd, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China.\\nEM afanayang31@163.com\\nRI Qiu, Bo/D-9569-2017\\nOI Lan, Jian/0000-0002-7688-7547\\nFU China National Natural Science Foundation [40788002, 40876001]; Ministry\\n   of Education; NSFC Creative Research Group [40921004]\\nFX This work is supported by China National Natural Science Foundation\\n   Projects (40788002, 40876001), China Foreign Expert \"111\" project\\n   through the Ministry of Education, and NSFC Creative Research Group\\n   Project (40921004).

Previous studies illustrate that the NGOC is characterized by an annual evaporation of similar to 0.9 m/yr. This evaporation generates high-sea-surface-salinity (SSS) water, which reaches a maxima in the NGOC (>37) and decreases to similar to 35 toward the entrance of the Gulf of California. The NGOC surface water is interannually modulated by fluctuations in evaporation and by fluctuations in the low-salinity water transported into the region by poleward eastern boundary currents. The fluctuations in the transport of low-salinity water are linked to the arrival of equatorially originated coastally trapped waves. The crucial role of the transport of low-salinity water for the interannual variability of SSS is illustrated by the 2006 and 2008 fall seasons, which include the lowest simulated salinity of the period 2003-2009. The lowest salinity in 2006 and 2008 cannot be explained solely by evaporation because 2006 was characterized by the largest evaporation of the period 2003-2009. However, the presence of the lowest-salinity environment can be attributed to the evaporation in conjunction with the largest upper ocean transport of low-salinity water carried to the NGOC by the 2006 and 2008 coastally trapped waves intensified poleward eastern boundary currents.\\nC1 [Zamudio, Luis] Florida State Univ, Ctr Ocean Atmospher Predict Studies, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.\\n   [Metzger, E.

Cumulative measurements are used to investigate the fraction of the wave energy lost in the breaking event that contributes to irreversible mixing of the background density gradient. Using the tank as a control volume, the distribution of energy into reflected waves, transmitted waves, and dissipation and irreversible mixing from the breaking event is determined. The overall fraction of wave energy lost in the breaking event that is converted irreversibly to mixing is found to be 3-8%, which is low compared with typical values of around 20% for steady, parallel, stratified shear instabilities. Spatial variability in the mixing event may contribute to the relatively low overall efficiency of the event.\\nC1 [Hult, E. L.; Koseff, J.

The most notable feature is a distinct Al maximum that appears as a 100-150 m thick layer that corresponds closely to the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC). The origin of this enrichment is likely from sediment resuspension processes in the source water regions of the EUC in the western Pacific. There is no corresponding feature in dissolved Fe but vertical profiles of Fe show typical nutrient-like distributions. Concentrations of dissolved Al decline slightly within the EUC along its advective flow path, but concentrations of Fe decline much more significantly at all depths along the section as a result of particle scavenging. Upwelling of the upper part of the EUC is the main source of Fe to the surface waters of this region, since eolian deposition, calculated from surface water dissolved Al, is minimal. The continual depletion of Fe in the source waters feeding the upwelling results in a decline of the Fe supply to surface waters. At 140 degrees W in the surface waters, the N:Fe ratio (similar to 15,000:1) implies the presence of sufficient Fe to allow full utilization of upwelled nitrate. By 110 degrees W, the N:Fe ratio is > 60,000:1, implying surface waters that are severely Fe-limited. The change in the status of the surface waters from Fe-sufficient to Fe-limited appears to be largely the result of the inorganic scavenging of Fe from the water column by the vertical particle rain rate, which itself is produced in surface waters by the upwelling of nutrients and Fe. Thus the progressive depletion of Fe from west to east appears to be directly related to production stimulated in the surface waters by the Fe-rich upwelling in the west. The large loss of Fe over this relatively short spatial scale in a rapidly moving water mass implies an extremely short residence time under these conditions and also suggests that the EUC might provide a natural laboratory for studying the relative scavenging rates for a variety of trace elements. These results imply that the persistent high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll conditions in the EEP are a result of Fe-limitation, but that changing climatologic conditions in the source regions of the EUC may result in temporal variation in the amount of that Fe supply.

Numerical simulations designed to explore the mechanisms responsible for these features in one particular wave reveal that shear instabilities occur when (i) the minimum Richardson number Ri in the pycnocline is less than about 0.1; (ii) L(x)/lambda > 0.8, where L(x) is the length of the unstable region with Ri < 0.25 and lambda is a half wavelength of the wave; and (iii) a linear spatial stability analysis predicts that In(a(f)/a(i)) > approximate to 4, where a(i) and a(f) are the amplitudes of perturbations entering and leaving the unstable region. The maximum energy loss rate in our simulations is 50 W m(-1), occurring at a frequency 8% below that with the maximum spatial growth rate.\\n   The observations revealed the presence of anomalously light fluid in the center of the wave above the pycnocline. Simulations of a wave encountering a patch of light surface water were used to model this effect. In the presence of a background current with near-surface shear, the simulated ISW has a trapped surface core. As this wave encounters a patch of lighter surface water, the light surface water at first passes beneath the core. Convective instabilities set in and the light fluid is entrained into the core. This results in the formation of overturning features, which exhibit some similarities with the observed overturns.\\nC1 [Lamb, Kevin G.] Univ Waterloo, Dept Appl Math, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.\\n   [Farmer, David] Univ Rhode Isl, Grad Sch Oceanog, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.\\nRP Lamb, KG (通讯作者)，Univ Waterloo, Dept Appl Math, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.\\nEM kglamb@uwaterloo.ca\\nFU Office of Naval Research\\nFX The observations described here were acquired as part of a collaboration\\n   with colleagues from Oregon State University; the Institute of Ocean\\n   Sciences, Sidney, British Columbia; and Scripps Institution of\\n   Oceanography.

Because the East/Japan Sea (EJS) has been considered to be a \"miniature ocean,\" tidal effects on the intermediate water of the EJS are investigated by using an eddy-resolving ocean general circulation model that can take account of M-2 and K-1 tides as well as oceanic flows. The simulated temperature and salinity in the intermediate layer are significantly improved by including tides. The improvement results from the combined effect of two internal tides. The M-2 internal tide, propagating into the interior of the EJS, enhances vertical mixing and brings watermass characteristics closer to those observed. The K-1 internal tide, trapped along the coast, induces southwestward flow along the Russian coast in the upper layer and thereby enhances the so-called Liman Current, which transports fresh waters with density conducive to the ventilation of intermediate waters in the EJS.\\nC1 [Lee, Ho Jin; Park, Jae-Hun; Wimbush, Mark] Univ Rhode Isl, Grad Sch Oceanog, Narragansett, RI 02882 USA.\\n   [Jung, Kyung Tae; Jang, Chan Joo] Korea Ocean Res & Dev Inst, Ansan, South Korea.\\n   [Cho, Yang-Ki] Chonnam Natl Univ, Fac Earth Syst & Environm Sci, Kwangju, South Korea.\\n   [Seo, Young-Kyo; Nam, Jong Ho] Korea Maritime Univ, Coll Ocean Sci & Technol, Pusan, South Korea.\\nRP Park, JH (通讯作者)，Univ Rhode Isl, Grad Sch Oceanog, Narragansett, RI 02882 USA.\\nEM jpark@gso.uri.edu\\nRI Cho, Yang-Ki/AAU-2549-2020\\nOI Cho, Yang-Ki/0000-0003-0026-0550; Lee, Ho Jin/0000-0002-5019-5104; Seo,\\n   Young Kyo/0000-0002-8838-113X; Park, Jae-Hun/0000-0003-0442-695X; Nam,\\n   Jong-Ho/0000-0002-9613-477X\\nFU KRCF; KORDI [PE98501]; Ministry of Knowledge and Economy of Korea\\n   [10033640]\\nFX We thank two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments and\\n   suggestions.

In this paper observations are presented of the occurrence of breaking waves under conditions of strong winds (10-25 m s(-1)) and fetch-limited seas (0-500 km) in the Gulf of Tehuantepec Experiment (GOTEX) in 2004. An airborne nadir-looking video camera, along with a global positioning system (GPS) and inertial motion unit (IMU), provided digital videos of the breaking sea surface and position in an earth frame. In particular, the authors present observations of Lambda(c), which is the distribution of breaking wave crest lengths per unit sea surface area, per unit increment in velocity c or scalar speed c, first introduced by O. M. Phillips. In another paper, the authors discuss the effect of processing methodology on the resulting shape of the Lambda(c) distribution. In this paper, the elemental method of measuring breaking crests is used to investigate the Lambda(c) distributions under a variety of wind and wave conditions. The integral and the first two moments of the Lambda(c) distributions are highly correlated with the active breaking rate and the active whitecap coverage. The computation of whitecap coverage yields a larger observational dataset from which the variability of whitecap coverage with wind speed, friction velocity, wave age, and wave slope is presented and compared to previous observations. The dependence of the active breaking rate on the spectral peak steepness is in agreement with previous studies. Dimensional analysis of Lambda(c) indicates that scaling with friction velocity and gravity, as in the classical fetch relations, collapses the breaking distributions more effectively than scaling with dominant wave parameters. Significant wave breaking is observed at speeds near the spectral peak in young seas only, consistent with previous studies. The fourth and fifth moments of Lambda(c) are related to the flux of momentum transferred by breaking waves to the underlying water and the rate of wave energy dissipation, respectively. The maximum in the fourth moment occurs at breaking speeds of 5-5.5 m s(-1), and the maximum in the fifth moment occurs at 5.8-6.8 m s(-1), apparently independent of wave age. However, when nondimensionalized by the phase speed at the peak of the local wave spectrum c(p), the maxima in the nondimensionalized fourth and fifth moments show a decreasing trend with wave age, obtaining the maxima at dimensionless speeds c/c(p) near unity at smaller wave ages and moving to lower dimensionless speeds c/c(p) << 1 at larger wave ages. The angular dependence of Lambda(c) is predominantly unimodal and better aligned with the wind direction than the dominant wave direction. However, the directional distribution of Lambda(c) is broadest for small c and often exhibits a bimodal structure for slow breaking speeds under developing seas. An asymmetry in the directional distribution is also observed for moderately developed seas. Observations are compared to the Phillips model for Lambda(c) in the equilibrium range of the wave spectrum. Although the ensemble of Lambda(c) distributions appears consistent with a c(-6) function, the distributions are not described by a constant power-law exponent.\\n   However, the &ULAMBDA(c) observations are described well by the Rayleigh distribution for slow and intermediate speeds, yet fall above the Rayleigh distribution for the fastest breaking speeds. From the Rayleigh description, it is found that the dimensionless width of the Lambda(c) distribution increases weakly with dimensionless fetch, s/u(*e) = 1.69 chi(0.06), where s is the Rayleigh parameter, u(*e) is the effective friction velocity, and the dimensionless fetch chi = gXu(*e)(-2) is a function of the fetch X and gravitational acceleration g. The nondimensionalized total length of breaking per unit sea surface area is found to decrease with dimensionless fetch for intermediate to fully developed seas, Au(*e)(2)g(-1) = 0.25 chi(-0.56), where A is the total length of breaking crests per unit sea surface area.\\nC1 [Kleiss, Jessica M.; Melville, W.

The ice cover transitioned from a cold early spring to a warm late spring state, with an increase in air temperature and incipient surface melt. During melt, brine salinity and brine dissolved inorganic carbon concentration (DIC) decreased from 67.3 to 18.7 and 3977.6 to 1163.5 mu mol kg(-1), respectively. In contrast, the salinity and DIC of under-ice water at depths of 3 and 5 m below the ice surface remained almost constant with average values of 32.4 +/- 0.3 (standard deviation) and 2163.1 +/- 16.8 mu mol kg(-1), respectively. The air-sea ice CO2 flux decreased from +0.7 to -1.0 mmol m(-2) day(-1) (where a positive value indicates CO2 being released to the atmosphere from the ice surface). During this early to late spring transition, brought on by surface melt, sea ice shifted from a source to a sink for atmospheric CO2, with a rapid decrease of brine DIC likely associated with a decrease in the partial pressure of CO2 of brine from a supersaturated to an undersaturated state compared to the atmosphere. Formation of superimposed ice coincident with melt was not sufficient to shut down ice-air gas exchange. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Seep sediments also contain smaller macrofaunal invertebrates whose nutritional pathways are not well understood. Using stable-isotope analysis, we investigate the utilization of chemosynthetically fixed and methane-derived organic matter by macrofauna. Biological sampling was conducted in three lower-slope GOM seep environs: Green Canyon (GC852, 1428 m), Atwater Valley (AT340, 2230 m), and Alaminos Canyon (AC601, 2384 m). Infaunal delta C-13 and delta N-15 exhibited a broad range of values; most infauna appeared to be heterotrophic, although several taxa had very light delta N-15 and delta C-13 values, indicating possible reliance on chemoautotrophic symbioses. The lightest delta C-13 and delta N-15 values were observed in nematodes (delta C-13=-54.6 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand, delta N-15=-6.1 +/- 0.2 parts per thousand) and one gastropod (delta C-13=delta N-15=-1.1 parts per thousand) from Green Canyon. Mixing-model results indicated that sulfur-oxidizing Beggiatoa may be an important food source for seep infauna; the rate of utilization ranged from 60% to 100% at Green Canyon and Atwater Valley. The overall range in isotope values was similar across the three sites, suggesting that biogeochemical processes may be very similar in these geographically distinct areas.

In a depth-averaged sense, the net flow in this channel is up estuary due to interaction of tidal forcing with the geometry of the larger basin. The depth-variable tidally averaged flow has the form of an estuarine exchange flow (downstream at the surface, upstream at depth) and varies in response to the neap spring transition. The weakening of the tidally averaged exchange during the spring tides appears to be a result of decreased stratification on the tidal time scale rather than changes in bed stress. The dynamics of the estuarine exchange flow are defined by a balance between the vertical divergence of the tidally averaged turbulent stress and the tidally averaged pressure gradient in the lower water column. In the upper water column, tidal stresses are important contributors, particularly during the neap tides. The usefulness of an effective eddy viscosity in the tidally averaged momentum equation is explored, and it is seen that the effective eddy viscosity on the subtidal time scale would need to be negative to close the momentum balance. This is due to the dominant contribution of tidally varying turbulent momentum fluxes, which have no specific relation to the subtidal circulation. Using a water column model, the validity of an effective eddy viscosity is explored; for periodically stratified water columns, a negative effective viscosity is required.\\nC1 [Stacey, Mark T.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.\\n   [Brennan, Matthew L.] Philip Williams & Associates, San Francisco, CA USA.\\n   [Burau, Jon R.] US Geol Survey, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA.\\n   [Monismith, Stephen G.] Stanford Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA.\\nRP Stacey, MT (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 665 Davis Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.\\nEM mstacey@socrates.berkeley.edu\\nOI Monismith, Stephen/0000-0002-7388-3313\\nFU Stanford University; NSF [OCE-0751970]\\nFX Support for the field campaign was provided by ONR.

Surface drifter are used to estimate NIO characteristics. Despite its spatial resolution limits, altimetry is used to estimate the geostrophic vorticity. Three characteristics of NIOs are considered: the relative frequency shift with respect to the local inertial frequency; the near-inertial variance; and the inverse excess bandwidth, which is interpreted as a decay time scale. The geostrophic mesoscale flow shifts the frequency of NIOs by approximately half its vorticity. Equatorward of 30 degrees N and S, this effect is added to a global pattern of blue shift of NIOs. While the global pattern of near-inertial variance is interpretable in terms of wind forcing, it is also observed that the geostrophic vorticity organizes the near-inertial variance; it is maximum for near zero values of the Laplacian of the vorticity and decreases for nonzero values, albeit not as much for positive as for negative values. Because the Laplacian of vorticity and vorticity are anticorrelated in the altimeter data set, overall, more near-inertial variance is found in anticyclonic vorticity regions than in cyclonic regions. While this is compatible with anticyclones trapping NIOs, the organization of near-inertial variance by the Laplacian of vorticity is also in very good agreement with previous theoretical and numerical predictions. The inverse bandwidth is a decreasing function of the gradient of vorticity, which acts like the gradient of planetary vorticity to increase the decay of NIOs from the ocean surface. Because the altimetry data set captures the largest vorticity gradients in energetic mesoscale regions, it is also observed that NIOs decay faster in large geostrophic eddy kinetic energy regions.\\nC1 [Elipot, Shane] Natl Oceanog Ctr, Liverpool L3 5DA, Merseyside, England.\\n   [Lumpkin, Rick] NOAA, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Miami, FL 33149 USA.\\n   [Prieto, German] Univ Los Andes, Dept Fis, Bogota 4976, Colombia.\\nRP Elipot, S (通讯作者)，Natl Oceanog Ctr, 6 Brownlow St,Joseph Proudman Bldg, Liverpool L3 5DA, Merseyside, England.\\nEM ship@pol.ac.uk\\nRI Prieto, German/B-8833-2008; Lumpkin, Rick/C-9615-2009; Prieto,\\n   German/O-3025-2019\\nOI Prieto, German/0000-0001-8538-7379; Lumpkin, Rick/0000-0002-6690-1704;\\n   Prieto, German/0000-0001-8538-7379; Elipot, Shane/0000-0001-6051-5426\\nFU Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies; UK Natural\\n   Environment Research Council; UK National Centre for Earth Observation;\\n   NOAA\\'s Office of Climate Observations; AOML; Natural Environment\\n   Research Council [soc010007, earth010002, noc010002] Funding Source:\\n   researchfish; NERC [earth010002, soc010007, noc010002] Funding Source:\\n   UKRI\\nFX Shane Elipot was partially supported by the Cooperative Institute for\\n   Marine and Atmospheric Studies, by the UK Natural Environment Research\\n   Council as a contribution to Oceans 2025, and by the UK National Centre\\n   for Earth Observation.

Nonlinear processes such as cabbeling and thermobaricity cause diapycnal motion as a consequence of isopycnal mixing. The nonlinear equation of state also causes the helical nature of neutral trajectories; as a consequence of this helical nature, it is not possible to define a continuous \"density\" surface that aligns with neutral tangent planes. The result is an additional diapycnal advection, which needs to be accounted for in water-mass analysis. In this paper, the authors take advantage of new techniques in constructing very accurate continuous density surfaces to more precisely estimate isopycnal and diapycnal processes caused by the nonlinear equation of state. They then quantify the diapycnal advection due to each of these nonlinear processes and show that they lead in total to a significant downward diapycnal advection, particularly in the Southern Ocean. The nonlinear processes are therefore another source of dense water formation in addition to high-latitude convection. To maintain the abyssal stratification in the global ocean, these dense water masses have to be brought back toward surface layers, and this can occur by either diabatic or adiabatic processes. Including these nonlinear processes into the advection-diffusion balance, the authors show that observed diapycnal diffusivities are unlikely to be able to support the amount of dense water produced in the global ocean, thus placing more importance on the adiabatic way of bringing the deep waters back to the surface.\\nC1 [Klocker, Andreas] Univ Tasmania, CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Hobart, Tas, Australia.\\n   [Klocker, Andreas] Univ Tasmania, Antarctic Climate & Ecosyst Cooperat Res Ctr, Hobart, Tas, Australia.\\n   [Klocker, Andreas] Univ Tasmania, Inst Antarctic & So Ocean Studies, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.\\n   [McDougall, Trevor J.] Ctr Australian Climate & Weather Res, Hobart, Tas, Australia.\\nRP Klocker, A (通讯作者)，MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.\\nEM aklocker@mit.edu\\nRI McDougall, Trevor J/A-6770-2013; Klocker, Andreas/E-4632-2011\\nOI Klocker, Andreas/0000-0002-2038-7922\\nFU CSIRO-UTAS; Wealth from Oceans National Research Flagship; Antarctic\\n   Climate and Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre (ACE CRC); CSIRO\\n   Wealth from Oceans National Research Flagship\\nFX We thank Louise Bell and Lea Crosswell for help with the figures in this\\n   paper and Russ Fiedler for his help with the model runs.

Estimated from both curve fitting and frequency domain Empirical Orthogonal Function methods, the characteristics of five-day variations have wave speeds ranging from 32 to 40 cm wavelengths ranging from 130 to 150 km, and e-folding time scales for growth ranging from 0.8 to 3 days. An analytical two-layer model used to explore linear stability characteristics indicates that bottom topography (two meridional ridges) is important for the Kuroshio stability characteristics in the Luzon Strait. In the two-layer model with the two ridges, the flow is stabilized for the long-wave mode but destabilized for the short-wave mode (due to increasing vertical shear in the horizontal velocity). The analytical model produces wavelengths and phase speeds for the most unstable mode which is similar to the observation, but the growth rate is underestimated. However, a spectral numerical model applied with a more realistic stratification and velocity structure does obtain faster growth rates comparable to the observations. Parameter sensitivity tests were conducted using the analytical model. The characteristics of the most unstable mode are most sensitive to the surface front location relative to the bottom topography but not sensitive to varying the density difference and thickness of the upper layer.\\nC1 [Tai, Jen-Hua; Tang, Tswen-Yung] Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei 106, Taiwan.\\n   [Gawarkiewicz, Glen] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\nRP Tang, TY (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, POB 23-13, Taipei 106, Taiwan.\\nEM tyt@ntu.edu.tw\\nRI Gawarkiewicz, Glen/R-6199-2019; Tai, Jen-Hua/AAZ-5330-2020\\nOI Tai, Jen-Hua/0000-0002-7231-9964\\nFU National Science Council [NSC 89-2611-M-002-017-OP2, NSC\\n   89-2611-M-002031-OP2, NSC 90-2611-M-002-018-OP2, NSC\\n   91-26112611-M-002-014]; Office of Naval Research [N-00014-04-1-0720]\\nFX Two reviewers\\' invaluable comments are truly appreciated.

Individual mode 2 packets were tracked between two moorings separated by 1 km; however, packets could not be tracked between moorings separated by greater distances from one another (similar to 10 km). The inability to track individual packets large distances through the mooring array combined with detailed observations from a ship suggest that these waves are short lived. The evolution of the ship-tracked wave group was recorded using acoustic backscatter, acoustic Doppler current profilers, and turbulence profiling. The leading mode 2 wave quickly changed form and developed a tail of short, small-amplitude mode 1 waves. The wavelength of the mode 1 oscillations agreed with that expected for a copropagating tail on the basis of linear theory. Turbulent dissipation in the mixed layer and radiation of the short mode 1 waves contributed to rapid energy loss in the leading mode 2 wave, consistent with the observed decay rate and short life span of only a few hours. The energy in the leading mode 2 wave was 10-100 times smaller than the energy of mode 1 nonlinear internal waves observed during the experiment; however, the magnitudes of wave-localized turbulent dissipation were similar.\\nC1 [Shroyer, E.

The atlas consists of mapped observations and derived quantities. Together they form a full representation of the ocean state and its seasonal cycle. The mapped observations are primarily altimeter data, satellite SST, and Argo profiles. GCM interpolation is used to synthesize these datasets, and the resulting atlas is a fairly close fit to each one of them. For observed quantities especially, the atlas is a practical means to evaluate free-running GCM simulations and to put field experiments into a broader context. The atlas-derived quantities include the middepth dynamic topography, as well as ocean fluxes of heat and salt freshwater. The atlas is publicly available online (www.ecco-group.org). This paper provides insight into two oceanographic problems that are the subject of vigorous ongoing research. First, regarding ocean circulation estimates, it can be inferred that the RMS uncertainty in modern surface dynamic topography (SDT) estimates is only on the order of 3.5 cm at scales beyond 300 km. In that context, it is found that assumptions of \"reference-level\" dynamic topography may yield significant errors (of order 2.2 cm or more) in SDT estimates using in situ data. Second, in the perspective of mode water investigations, it is estimated that ocean fluxes (advection plus mixing) largely contribute to the seasonal fluctuation in heat content and freshwater/salt content. Hence, representing the seasonal cycle as a simple interplay of air sea flux and ocean storage would not yield a meaningful approximation. For the salt freshwater seasonal cycle especially, contributions from ocean fluxes usually exceed direct air sea flux contributions.\\nC1 MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.\\nRP Forget, G (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.\\nEM gforget@mit.edu\\nFU ECCO GODAE group; National Ocean Partnership Program (NOPP); National\\n   Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA); CNES\\nFX Carl Wunsch, Patrick Heimbach, colleagues at MIT, and the two anonymous\\n   reviewers greatly helped improve this manuscript.

No effect was observed in the upwelling site, but in Peruvian waters urea additions resulted in increased phytoplankton pigments and phosphate drawdown only when Ni was added concurrently, suggesting a biochemically dependent Ni-urea colimitation In the Gulf of California, Ni additions without urea resulted in increased abundances of cyanobacteria, picoeukaryotes, and the corresponding pigments As urea additions showed the overall phytoplankton community was also urea-limited, it appears that the cyanobactena and potentially the picoeukaryotes were colimited by Ni and urea in a biochemically independent fashion. In parallel, radiotracer-based uptake experiments were used to study the kinetics and spatial variation of biological Ni assimilation. In these experiments, the added radiotracer rarely equilibrated with the natural Ni present, precluding estimates a determination of in situ Ni uptake rates and suggesting that much of the natural Ni was not bioavailable. The lack of equilibration likely did not preclude the measurement of community Ni uptake kinetics, nor the comparison of measured rates between locations The highest VmaxKp-1 values, which reflect a competitive advantage in Ni acquisition at low concentrations, were observed in stratified nitrogen-deplete communities, potentially linking Ni and nitrogen biogeochemistry in a manner consistent with the biochemical utilization of Ni. Overall, uptake rates were higher in the euphotic rather than non-euphotic zone communities, directly reconciling the nutrient-like depth profile of Ni The Ni uptake rates observed at the nitrate-replete Fe-deplete Peru stations were an order of magnitude lower than the other sites This result agrees with calculations suggesting that saturation of the cell surface with Ni and iron (Fe) transporters may limit uptake rates in low Fe waters.

Global heat flow compilations indicate that Much of the seafloor loses a significant fraction of lithospheric heat because Of fluid flow from the crust, and most of this advective heat loss Occurs on ridge flanks, areas far from the thermal influence of magmatic emplacement at seafloor spreading centers. The driving forces available to move fluid between the crust and ocean are modest, and most of the seafloor is blanketed by low-permeability sediment that prevents vertical fluid flow at thermally significant rates. Thus, Most Of the thermally important fluid exchange between the crust and ocean must occur where volcanic rocks are exposed at the seafloor; little fluid exchange on ridge flanks Occurs through seafloor sediments overlying volcanic crustal rocks. Seamounts and other basement Outcrops focus ridge-flank hydrothermal exchange between the crust and the ocean. We describe the driving forces responsible for hydrothermal flows on ridge flanks, and the impacts that these systems have on crustal heat loss, fluid composition, and subseafloor microbiology. We show data collected from two ridge-flank areas that illustrate how the extent of fluid exchange, lithospheric heat loss, and chemical reaction and transport depend on the rate Of fluid flow, fluid residence time, and temperature in crustal hydrologic systems. Seamounts are ideal places to sample crustal fluids as they exit the crust and enter the ocean, to determine their chemical and microbial characteristics, and to assess the importance of this global hydrogeologic system on the evolution of Earths lithosphere, ocean, and biosphere.\\nC1 [Fisher, Andrew T.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.\\n   [Fisher, Andrew T.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Inst Geophys & Planetary Phys, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.\\n   [Wheat, C.

The simulated circulation pattern in the deep basin is relatively stable, cyclonic, and has little seasonal change. The Bering Slope Current is estimated at 5 Sv and the Kamchatka Current at 20 Sv. The modeled volume transports through the Aleutian passes compared reasonably well with observations. It is confirmed that subtidal clockwise circulation around St. George and St. Paul islands are driven by tidal rectification. The simulation results show that wind-wave mixing and tidal stirring are the main factors controlling the formation of the upper and the bottom mixed layers, respectively. The mechanism of thermocline and the cold pool (summer minimum-temperature water) formation in the middle shelf are investigated in depth. The CIOM reproduces the cold winter-convective water in the middle shelf that forms the bottom cold pool, which persists throughout the summer until sea surface cooling and strong wind mixing in fall, leading to an unstable vertical water column and eventually to vertically well-mixed water in the winter. Sensitivity experiments show that tidal and wind-wave mixing are two important factors in accurately estimating the volume of the cold pool, which is the ideal marine habitat for cold water species.\\nC1 [Wang, Jia] NOAA, Great Lakes Environm Res Lab, Ann Arbor, MI 48108 USA.\\n   [Hu, Haoguo] Univ Michigan, Inst Limnol & Ecosyst Res, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48108 USA.\\nRP Wang, J (通讯作者)，NOAA, Great Lakes Environm Res Lab, 4840 S State Rd, Ann Arbor, MI 48108 USA.\\nEM hghu@umich.edu; jia.wang@noaa.gov\\nOI Wang, Jia/0000-0003-4154-9721\\nFU IARC/JAMSTEC Cooperative Agreement, University of Alaska Costal Marine\\n   Institute and Minerals Management Service; NOAA Russian-American\\n   Long-Term Census of the Arctic (RUSALCA)\\nFX Thanks for support from IARC/JAMSTEC Cooperative Agreement, University\\n   of Alaska Costal Marine Institute and Minerals Management Service, and\\n   the NOAA Russian-American Long-Term Census of the Arctic (RUSALCA)\\n   International Polar Year (IPY) modeling project awarded to J.W.

Especially poorly-studied in arctic waters are the gelatinous zooplankton, which are difficult to study using traditional oceanographic methods. A distinct zooplanktivore community was characterized in the surface 100 m by use of a Remotely Operated Vehicle, net collections, and SCUBA diving. The large scyphomedusa, Chrysaora melanaster, was associated with the warm Pacific water at similar to 35-75 m depth. A diverse ctenophore community lived mainly above the C. melanaster layer, including Dryodora glandula, a specialized predator of larvaceans, Beroe cucumis, a predator of other ctenophores, and the extremely fragile Bolinopsis infundibulum, which was the most abundant species. Gut content analyses showed that Mertensia ovum selectively consumed the largest copepods (Calanus spp.) and amphipods (Parathemisto libellula): B. infundibulum consumed smaller copepods and pteropods (Limacina helicina). Large copepods were digested by M. ovum in similar to 12 h at -1.5 to 0 degrees C, but by B. infundibulum in only similar to 4 h. We estimated that M. ovum consumed an average of similar to 2% d(-1) of the Calanus spp. copepods and that B. infundibulum consumed similar to 4% d(-1) of copepods < 3 mm prosome length. These are significant consumption rates given that Calanus spp. have life-cycles of 2 or more years and are eaten by vertebrates including bowhead whales and arctic cod. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The eddy formed when Sitka and Yakutat eddies merged in June 2005. Sitka and Yakutat eddies form in the northeastern GoA and travel westward carrying anomalous energy, temperature, and chemical properties. The glider crossed the eddy seven times from mid-August to late October 2005. A temperature maximum, at 130 m depth near the eddy\\'s center, is indicative of coastal water. The strongest azimuthal current is 0.35 m s(-1), occurring at 270 m depth and 17.5 km radius. The eddy\\'s Rossby (Burger) number is 0.16 (0.47). Using a model with nonzero constant potential vorticity anomaly only within each depth\\'s radius of strongest current, a function is fit to azimuthal current. The fit explains a large percentage of the current\\'s radial variance, with a squared correlation coefficient of >= 0.9 at the depths of strongest current (270 m) and weakest stratification (360 m). Temporal trends in azimuthal volume transport rate and depth mean potential vorticity are not observed during the glider survey.\\nC1 [Martin, J. P.; Lee, C.

The surface wind stress is the primary driver for variability in the upper Arctic Ocean and sea ice. The seasonal variability of the surface wind over the western Arctic is strongly influenced by a high sea level pressure center that emerges in the fall and diminishes in the summer. The wind stress and sea ice velocity are both anticyclonic from fall to spring and thus force an upwelling along the Alaskan and Canadian coast and downwelling in the interior Beaufort Sea. The upwelling and downwelling varied significantly on the interannual to decadal time scales from 1979 to 2006. There was no significant correlation between the upwelling/downwelling rate in the Beaufort Sea and the Arctic Oscillation index over this 28 year period. The coastal upwelling and interior downwelling in the Beaufort Sea had gradually intensified from 1979 to 2006. This change was almost entirely due to the increase in sea ice velocity according to three additional sensitivity calculations. The anticyclonic ice velocity over the western Arctic Ocean accelerated in the 28 year period, and the acceleration was not driven solely by the wind stress. The geostrophic wind condition was actually similar between 1979-1986 and 1997-2004. However, the ice velocity was much greater in the latter period. We hypothesize that the change in ice dynamics (thinner and less areal coverage) was responsible for the change of ice velocity.\\nC1 Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Phys Oceanog, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\nRP Yang, JY (通讯作者)，Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Phys Oceanog, 266 Woods Hole Rd, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\nEM jyang@whoi.edu\\nFU National Science Foundation [OPP0424074, ARC-0902090]; WHOI Arctic\\n   Initiative; NASA [NNG05GN93G]\\nFX This study has been supported by the National Science Foundation\\'s\\n   Office of Polar Program (OPP0424074 and ARC-0902090), WHOI Arctic\\n   Initiative, and NASA\\'s Cryospheric Science Program (NNG05GN93G).

We used the ratio of photosynthetically available radiation at the surface (surface PAR) to in situ quantum irradiance (in situ QI) at about 40 m as an index of opacity (surface PAR/in situ QI), which began to increase in the middle of April and peaked between the end of June and the middle of July 2005. This ratio then decreased toward winter. The ratio increased again beginning in January 2006, and large peaks were observed in June and July 2006. As an index of chlorophyll abundance we used the ratio of spectral irradiance at wavelengths of 555 and 443 nm (Ed(555)/Ed(443)) at about 40 m; seasonal variability of this ratio synchronized well with the attenuation coefficient \"k\" estimated with surface PAR, in situ QI, and BLOOMS depth. We estimated primary productivity (PP) using Ed(555)/Ed(443) and an empirical equation based on a previous model but improved on the basis of shipboard observations. Estimated PP agreed well with observed PR Seasonal variability of estimated PP was synchronized with that of organic carbon flux observed by sediment traps from approximately 150, 540, 1000, and 5000 m. This study demonstrates that time-series observations of in situ optical fields could contribute to the estimation of primary productivity and the study of the biological pump in the ocean.

The eddies had lifetimes of up to 5 years, remained close to the shelfbreak, and had relatively constant size and strength until they encountered the Alaskan Stream where they appeared to spawn smaller, shorter-lived anticyclones. The azimuthal velocity field was vigorous (25-40 cm s(-1)) and in gradient wind balance with Rossby numbers of similar to 0.05. Conservation of salt and azimuthal mass transports (between 20 m and the depth of the 32.2 isohaline) from shipboard surveys in May and August 2003 suggest little mass exchange occurred between the surface layers of the eddy and ambient waters. Chlorophyll concentrations were greater in the eddy than in ambient waters in both May and August. In May, the chlorophyll was patchily distributed, while in August dense chlorophyll concentrations occurred in and beneath the seasonal thermocline within 50 km of the eddy center. The high August chlorophyll concentrations might have been fostered by a broad and shallow (<similar to 150 m) upwelling of the eddy center between May and August.\\n   It appears likely that as Yakutat Eddies approach the shelfbreak non-linear processes will modify the slope flow field (and the stability and structure of the shelfbreak front), leading to cross-slope flows and flow reversals. This interaction may induce similar to 30 km-wide streamers of shelf water to flow around the trailing edge of the anticyclone. The role of streamers in the freshwater and nutrient budgets of the GOA shelf and basin is unknown, but their contribution to these budgets will depend on the trajectory of a Yakutat Eddy, especially its proximity to the shelfbreak as the eddy propagates along the GOA continental slope.

We report on a study of two anticyclonic mesoscale eddies in this region observed through in situ sampling during August and September 2007. Both eddies exhibited in their cores q-S profiles with warmer, fresher water relative to the properties of the ambient basin water between 150-and 300-m depths. Hydrographic properties and satellite altimetry data were analyzed to identify likely formation regions for each feature. One eddy, sampled near Yakutat, Alaska, originated in the Sitka formation region (221-223 degrees E); the second eddy, sampled south of Kodiak Island, originated near the Kenai Peninsula, southeast of the Kennedy and Stevenson entrances to Cook Inlet, an area not previously studied as a formation region. Subsequent analysis of 16 years of satellite altimeter data (from 1992 to 2008) with an algorithm designed to identify and track eddies revealed approximately six Kenai eddies that have formed in this region. Although this number constitutes only 3.2% of the 188 eddies identified by the algorithm during this period, it represents 15.4% of the 39 eddies that formed in or propagated westward into the Alaskan Stream.\\nC1 [Rovegno, P.

The known features of bottom water circulation such as boundary currents and inter-basin exchanges are well represented in the hindcast solution. Further, the hindcast solution reveals a basin-wide, anti-cyclonic deep circulation pattern with the main inflow located in the east, in the Perth Basin, and outflow in the west along the African continent and Madagascar. Inter-basin westward transport at 10 degrees S across the Ninetyeast Ridge and along the Mascarene Plateau connect the inflow and outflow locations. The model develops a net bottom water inflow of 10 +/- 8 Sv (mean +/- standard deviation) across 32 degrees S, below approximately 3500 m of which 4 +/- 7 Sv are returned south across the same latitude in the deep layers between 2000 and 3500 m. Significant variability on intra-seasonal, semi-annual and annual time scales is present in the abyssal flow fields. The vertical mixing algorithm, based on resolved vertical shear, suggests enhanced diapycnal upwelling in the vicinity of the Central Indian Ridge. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

These types of waves are seldom observed in nature. The mode 2 ISWs typically showed upward (downward) displacement of isotherms in the upper (lower) water column and three layers of eastward, westward, and eastward current from the uppermost to bottommost portions of a wave. In summer, westward-propagating mode 2 ISWs were observed only occasionally. These waves generally appeared after mode 1 ISWs, a feature that may relate to the diurnal tide with a period of approximately 24 hours. The displacement of isotherms induced by mode 2 ISWs was 20 +/- 14 m at 75 m and -22 +/- 15 m at 240 m, and the characteristic time scale was approximately 8.0 +/- 4.3 min. In winter, mode 2 ISWs were more active but mode 1 ISWs were rarely observed. Isotherm displacement by mode 2 ISWs in winter was 30 +/- 18 m at 75 m and -26 +/- 16 m at 240 m, and the average characteristic time scale was 6.9 +/- 4.6 min. The mode 2 ISWs thus had larger amplitudes and smaller time scales in winter than they did in summer. The observed vertical temperature profile also showed notable seasonal change. The thermocline was shallow in summer and deep in winter. In winter, vertical temperature profiles indicated that the main thermocline was located near middepth over the upper continental slope near the 350 m isobath. Mode 1 ISWs were more active in summer than in winter, reflecting the larger Ursell numbers for mode 1 ISWs in summer. Among mode 2 ISWs in summer, 90% appeared after mode 1 ISWs. These results suggest that mode 2 ISWs could be related to mode 1 ISWs. In contrast, mode 2 ISWs were more active in winter than in summer, with larger mode 2 Ursell numbers also found in winter. Among winter mode 2 ISWs, 72% appeared without mode 1 ISWs. Mode 2 ISWs in winter could be related to the main thermocline being located near middepth. These seasonal variations of mode 2 ISWs were correlated with the seasonal change of local stratification. Further study on the different generating mechanisms of mode 2 ISWs in summer and winter is needed.\\nC1 [Yang, Yiing Jang] Naval Acad, Dept Marine Sci, Kaohsiung 813, Taiwan.\\n   [Fang, Ying Chih; Chang, Ming-Huei; Tang, Tswen Yung] Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei 106, Taiwan.\\n   [Ramp, Steven R.] USN, Postgrad Sch, Dept Oceanog, Monterey, CA 93943 USA.\\n   [Kao, Chih-Chung] Fortune Inst Technol, Dept Informat Management, Kaohsiung 831, Taiwan.\\nRP Yang, YJ (通讯作者)，Naval Acad, Dept Marine Sci, POB 90175, Kaohsiung 813, Taiwan.\\nEM yjyang@cna.edu.tw; r94241103@ntu.edu.tw; mhchang@ntou.edu.tw;\\n   sramp@mbari.org; kcc7879@center.fotech.edu.tw; tyt@ntu.edu.tw\\nOI Yang, Yiing-Jang/0000-0002-6637-9311; CHANG,\\n   MING-HUEI/0000-0002-6409-7652\\nFU National Science Council, Taiwan [NSC 93-2611-M-012-001, NSC\\n   94-2611-M-012-001, NSC 94-2611-M-268-001, NSC 95-2611-M-268-001, NSC\\n   93-2611-M-002-019, NSC 94-2611-M-002-003]\\nFX This study was supported by the National Science Council, Taiwan, under\\n   grants NSC 93-2611-M-012-001 and NSC 94-2611-M-012-001 for Y.

Using a 3-D physical-biogeochemical model, we simulate the partial pressure of CO2 in surface water (pCO(2sea)) and air-sea CO2 flux in the tropical and subtropical regions from 1990 to 2004. The model reproduces well the observed spatial differences in physical and biogeochemical processes, such as: (1) relatively higher sea surface temperature (SST), and lower dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and pCO(2sea) in the western than in the central tropical-subtropical Pacific, and (2) predominantly seasonal and interannual variations in the subtropical and tropical Pacific, respectively. Our model results suggest a non-negligible contribution of the wind variability to that of the air-sea CO2 flux in the central tropical Pacific, but the modeled contribution of 7% is much less than that from a previous modeling study (30%; McKinley et al., 2004). While DIC increases in the entire region, SST increases in the subtropical and western tropical Pacific but decreases in the central tropical Pacific from 1990 to 2004. As a result, the interannual PCO2sea variability is different in different regions. The PCO2sea temporal variation is found to be primarily controlled by SST and DIC, although the role of salinity and total alkalinity, both of which also control PCO2sea, need to be elucidated by long-term observations and eddy-permitting models for better estimation of the interannual variability of air-sea CO2 flux.\\nC1 [Fujii, Masahiko; Inoue, Hisayuki Y.] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Environm Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan.\\n   [Fujii, Masahiko] Hokkaido Univ, Ctr Sustainabil Sci, Sustainabil Governance Project, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600809, Japan.\\n   [Chai, Fei; Shi, Lei] Univ Maine, Sch Marine Sci, Orono, ME 04469 USA.\\n   [Ishii, Masao] Meteorol Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050052, Japan.\\nRP Fujii, M (通讯作者)，Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Environm Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan.\\nEM mfujii@ees.hokudai.ac.jp\\nRI Yoshikawa, Hisayuki/A-4056-2012\\nOI Yoshikawa, Hisayuki/0000-0002-9936-2188; Ishii,\\n   Masao/0000-0002-7328-4599\\nNR 69\\nTC 14\\nZ9 16\\nU1 2\\nU2 19\\nPU SPRINGER\\nPI DORDRECHT\\nPA VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS\\nSN 0916-8370\\nEI 1573-868X\\nJ9 J OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

However, it is well known that air-sea pCO(2) disequilibria can be large (ocean pCO(2) ranging from similar to 400 mu atm above atmospheric saturation to similar to 250 mu atm below) in eastern boundary currents, and it has been hypothesized that these regions may be an appreciable net carbon sink. In addition it has been shown that the high productivity in these regions (responsible for the exceptionally low surface pCO(2)) can cause nutrients and inorganic carbon to become more concentrated in the lower layer of the water column over the shelf relative to adjacent open ocean waters of the same density. This paper explores the potential role of the winter season in determining the net annual CO2 flux in temperate zone eastern boundary currents, using the results from a box model. The model is parameterized and forced to represent the northernmost part of the upwelling region on the North American Pacific coast. Model results are compared to the few summer data that exist in that region. The model is also used to determine the effect that upwelling and downwelling strength have on the net annual CO2 flux. Results show that downwelling may play an important role in limiting the amount of CO2 outgassing that occurs during winter. Finally data from three distinct regions on the Pacific coast are compared to highlight the importance of upwelling and downwelling strength in determining carbon fluxes in eastern boundary currents and to suggest that other features, such as shelf width, are likely to be important.\\nC1 [Ianson, Debby] Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Sidney, BC V8L 4B2, Canada.\\n   [Ianson, Debby] Univ Victoria, Sch Earth & Ocean Sci, Victoria, BC V8W 3P6, Canada.\\n   [Feely, Richard A.; Sabine, Christopher L.; Juranek, Lauren W.] NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.\\nRP Ianson, D (通讯作者)，Fisheries & Oceans Canada, POB 6000, Sidney, BC V8L 4B2, Canada.\\nEM debby.ianson@dfo-mpo.gc.ca\\nRI Feely, Richard A./ABI-5740-2020\\nOI Juranek, Laurie/0000-0002-4922-8263; Ianson, Debby/0000-0001-8317-5196\\nNR 47\\nTC 16\\nZ9 22\\nU1 0\\nU2 10\\nPU SPRINGER\\nPI DORDRECHT\\nPA VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS\\nSN 0916-8370\\nEI 1573-868X\\nJ9 J OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

Eight experiments of 3-5 days each were conducted over the course of two cruises in May-June 2006 and April 2007 following the trajectories of satellite-tracked drifters. Rates of phytoplankton growth and microzooplankton grazing were determined by daily in situ dilution incubations at 8 depths spanning the euphotic zone. Mesozooplankton grazing was assessed by gut fluorescence analysis of animals collected from net tows through the euphotic zone. We compared directly the net rates of change observed for the ambient phytoplankton community to the net growth rates predicted from experimental determinations of each process rate. The resulting relationship accounted for 91% of the variability observed, providing strong support for the growth-grazing hypothesis. In addition, grazing by mesozooplankton was unexpectedly high and variable, driving a substantial positive to negative shift in phytoplankton net rate of change between years despite comparable environmental conditions and similar high growth rates and suggesting strong top-down control potential. The demonstrated agreement between net ambient and experimental community changes is an important point of validation for using field data to parameterize models. Data sets of this type may provide an important source of new information and rate constraints for developing better coupled biological-physical models of upwelling system dynamics.

In fall 2002 a mooring array located near 152 degrees W measured 11 significant upwelling events that brought warm and salty Atlantic water to shallow depths. When comparing the storms that caused these events to other Aleutian lows that did not induce upwelling, interesting trends emerged. Upwelling occurred most frequently when storms were located in a region near the eastern end of the Aleutian Island Arc and Alaskan Peninsula. Not only were these storms deep but they generally had northward-tending trajectories. While the steering flow aloft aided this northward progression, the occurrence of lee cyclogenesis due to the orography of Alaska seems to play a role as well in expanding the meridional influence of the storms. In late fall and early winter both the intensity and frequency of the upwelling diminished significantly at the array site. It is argued that the reduction in amplitude was due to the onset of heavy pack ice, while the decreased frequency was due to two different upper-level atmospheric blocking patterns inhibiting the far field influence of the storms.\\nC1 [Pickart, Robert S.; Torres, Daniel J.; Fratantoni, Paula S.; Goldsmith, Roger A.; Yang, Jiayan] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\n   [Moore, G.

We have developed a mediator-based data integration system called Cartel for biological oceanography data. A mediation approach is appropriate in cases where a single central warehouse is not desirable, such as when the needed data sources change frequently through time, or when there are advantages for holding heterogeneous data in their native formats. Through Cartel, data sources of a variety of types can be registered to the system, and users can query against simplified virtual schemas, without needing to know the underlying schema and computational capabilities of each data source. The system can operate on a variety of relational and geospatial data formats, and can perform joins between formats. We tested the performance of the Cartel mediator in two biological oceanography application areas, and found that the system was able to support the variety of data types needed in a typical ecology study, but that the response times were unacceptably slow when very large databases (i.e. Ocean Biogeographic Information System and the World Ocean Atlas) were used. Indexing and caching are currently being added to the system to improve response times. The mediator is an open-source product, and was developed to be a generic, extensible component available to projects developing oceanography data systems. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Rates of primary production (PP) and bacterial production (BP) were higher in the summer than in spring and in shelf waters than in the basin. Most surprisingly, PP was 3-fold higher in 2004 than in 2002; ice-corrected rates were 1581 and 458 Mg C m(-2) d(-1), respectively, for the entire region. The difference between years was mainly due to low ice coverage in the summer of 2004. The spatial and temporal variation in PP led to comparable variation in BR Although temperature explained as much variability in BP as did PP or phytoplankton biomass, there was no relationship between temperature and bacterial growth rates above about 0 degrees C. The average ratio of BP to PP was 0.06 and 0.79 when ice-corrected PP rates were greater than and less than 100 mg C m(-2) d(-1), respectively; the overall average was 0.34. Bacteria accounted for a highly variable fraction of total respiration, from 3% to over 60% with a mean of 25%. Likewise, the fraction of PP consumed by bacterial respiration, when calculated from growth efficiency (average of 6.9%) and BP estimates, varied greatly over time and space (7% to > 500%). The apparent uncoupling between respiration and PP has several implications for carbon export and storage in the western Arctic Ocean.

Distinctive differences in hydrographic conditions were observed between these two years, allowing us to consider several factors that could impact NCP and carbon cycling in both the Chukchi Shelf and the adjacent Canada Basin. Between the spring and summer cruises high rates of phytoplankton production over the Chukchi shelf resulted in a significant drawdown of DIC in the mixed layer and the associated production of DOC/N and POC/N. As in 2002, the highest rates of NCP occurred over the northeastern part of the Chukchi shelf near the head of Barrow Canyon, which has historically been a hotspot for biological activity in the region. However, in 2004, rates of NCP over most of the northeastern shelf were similar and in some cases higher than rates observed in 2002. This was unexpected due to a greater influence of low-nutrient waters from the Alaskan Coastal Current in 2004, which should have suppressed rates of NCP compared to 2002. Between spring and summer of 2004, normalized concentrations of DIC in the mixed layer decreased by as much as 280 mu mol kg(-1), while DOC and DON increased by similar to 16 and 9 mu mol kg(-1), respectively. Given the decreased availability of inorganic nutrients in 2004, rates of NCP could be attributed to increased light penetration, which may have allowed phytoplankton to increase utilization of nutrients deeper in the water column. In addition, there was a rapid and extensive retreat of the ice cover in summer 2004 with warmer temperatures in the mixed layer that could have enhanced NCP. Estimates of NCP near the head of Barrow Canyon in 2004 were similar to 1500 mg carbon (C) m(-2) d(-1) which was similar to 400 mg C m(-2) d(-1) higher than the same location in 2002. Estimates of NCP over the shelf-break and deep Canada Basin were low in both years, confirming that there is little primary production in the interior of the western Arctic Ocean due to near-zero concentrations of inorganic nitrate in the mixed layer.

A basin-scale ocean circulation-biogeochemistry model implemented with a dynamic phytoplankton model is employed to explore the spatial and temporal variability of the phytoplankton carbon to chlorophyll (C:Chl) ratio in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. The dynamic model computes the phytoplankton C:Chl ratio as a function of light, nitrate, iron, and temperature. The model reproduces well the general features of phytoplankton dynamics in this region, e.g., the deeper chlorophyll maximum (DCM) in the western warm pool and shallower DCM in the upwelling region. The model predicts large spatial and temporal variations of the C:Chl ratio. The mixed layer C:Chl ratio increases from < 100 in the eastern upwelling region to > 150 in the warm pool, whereas subsurface ratio is similar to 50 below 100 m. The model produces a weak seasonality in the mixed layer C:Chl ratio but strong interannual variability that is associated with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. The warm pool has strong anomalies during the cold phase of the ENSO with a reduced C:Chl ratio and a shoaled DCM. However, the upwelling region reveals strong anomalies during the warm phase of the ENSO, showing an increased C:Chl ratio in the euphotic zone and a deepened DCM. The predicted large spatial and temporal variations of the C:Chl ratio have potential implications for the carbon uptake in the equatorial Pacific.\\nC1 [Wang, Xiujun; Murtugudde, Raghu; Busalacchi, Antonio J.] Univ Maryland, Earth Syst Sci Interdisciplinary Ctr, College Pk, MD 20740 USA.\\n   [Le Borgne, Robert] Ctr Noumea, Inst Rech Dev, Noumea 98848, New Caledonia.\\n   [Behrenfeld, Michael] Oregon State Univ, Dept Bot & Plant Pathol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.\\nRP Wang, XJ (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Earth Syst Sci Interdisciplinary Ctr, Suite 4001,M Sq Off Bldg 950,5825 Univ Res Court, College Pk, MD 20740 USA.\\nEM wwang@essic.umd.edu\\nRI , Nobody/M-9571-2019; Wang, Xiujun/F-2641-2010\\nOI Wang, Xiujun/0000-0002-2859-8011\\nFU NASA\\nFX This research is supported by NASA.

(2004). This Eulerian wave-averaged model captures wave effects on currents (WEC) in a manner that leads to simple interpretations. The dynamically conservative WEC are the vortex force and material transport by Stokes drift and the sea level adjustment by wave set-down and setup. In the setting considered here there are also important current effects on the waves (CEW): induction of a Doppler shift by currents and surface elevation variation in the wave dispersion relation. Nonconservative effects, due to wave breaking and bottom drag, also play a prominent role in generating and equilibrating the mean alongshore current, consistent with prior studies. High bottom drag stabilizes the currents, while a drag reduction below a critical threshold value leads to shear instability with nearly periodic, alongshore-fluctuating eddies. An even smaller bottom drag yields irregular eddy motions with intermittent offshore eruption of vortex pairs from the meandering alongshore current. Several alternative parameterizations of the bottom drag are contrasted here. Including CEW in the model leads to a delay in the onset of the instability, a suppression of fluctuations in cross-shore velocity and lateral Reynolds stress, and an enhancement of the mean alongshore velocity. The WEC increase the Reynolds stress in the offshore region, and the conservative vortex force and mean advection are comparable in magnitude to the breaking acceleration and bottom drag. Conversely, the CEW reduce the Reynolds stress and attenuate the breaking acceleration through refractive focusing by current shear. Overall, the WEC enhance the instantaneous cross-shore momentum flux to induce more energetic eddy motions and retard the mean alongshore current, while the CEW stabilize the fluctuations and help maintain a strong mean current.\\nC1 [Uchiyama, Yusuke; McWilliams, James C.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Geophys & Planetary Phys, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.\\n   [Restrepo, Juan M.] Univ Arizona, Dept Math, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.\\n   [Restrepo, Juan M.] Univ Arizona, Dept Phys, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.\\nRP Uchiyama, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Geophys & Planetary Phys, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.\\nEM uchiyama@atmos.ucla.edu\\nRI Uchiyama, Yusuke/M-4395-2016; Restrepo, Juan M./O-3400-2019\\nOI Uchiyama, Yusuke/0000-0002-2234-3608; Restrepo, Juan\\n   M./0000-0003-2609-2882\\nFU National Science Foundation [DMS-0723757]; Office of Naval Research\\n   [N00014- 04- 1- 0166]\\nFX We appreciate the support from the National Science Foundation (\\n   DMS-0723757)and Office of Naval Research ( N00014- 04- 1- 0166).

When Q(f) was moderately high, the tidally averaged length of the estuary L(5), here defined as the distance from the mouth to the up-estuary location where the vertically averaged salinity is 5 psu, fluctuated by more than 47 km over the spring-neap cycle, ranging from 28 to > 75 km. During low flow periods, L(5) varied very little over the spring-neap cycle and approached a steady length. The response is quantified and compared to predictions of a linearized model derived from the global estuarine salt balance. The model is forced by fluctuations in Q(f) and U(T) relative to average discharge Q(o) and tidal amplitude U(To) and predicts the linear response time scale tau and the steady-state length L(o) for average forcing. Two vertical mixing schemes are considered, in which 1) mixing is proportional to U(T) and 2) dependence of mixing on stratification is also parameterized. Based on least squares fits between L(5) and estuary length predicted by the model, estimated t varied by an order of magnitude from a period of high average discharge (Q(o) = 750 m(3) s(-1), tau = 4.2 days) to a period of low discharge (Q(o) = 170 m(3) s(-1), tau = 40.4 days). Over the range of observed discharge, L(o) proportional to Q(o) (-0.30 +/- 0.03), consistent with the theoretical scaling for an estuary whose landward salt flux is driven by vertical estuarine exchange circulation. Estimated tau was proportional to the discharge advection time scale (L(o)A/Q(o), where A is the cross-sectional area of the estuary). However, tau was 3-4 times larger than the theoretical prediction. The model with stratification-dependent mixing predicted variations in L(5) with higher skill than the model with mixing proportional to U(T). This model provides insight into the time-dependent response of a partially stratified estuary to changes in forcing and explains the strong dependence of the amplitude of the spring-neap response on freshwater discharge. However, the utility of the linear model is limited because it assumes a uniform channel, and because the underlying dynamics are nonlinear, and the forcing Q(f) and U(T) can undergo large amplitude variations. River discharge, in particular, can vary by over an order of magnitude over time scales comparable to or shorter than the response time scale of the estuary.\\nC1 [Lerczak, James A.] Oregon State Univ, Coll Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.\\n   [Geyer, W.

The database used for this study is about 3 times larger than the 0.94 million used for our earlier paper [Takahashi et al., 2002. Global sea-air CO2 flux based on climatological surface ocean pCO(2), and seasonal biological and temperature effects. Deep-Sea Res. 11, 49, 1601-1622]. A time-trend analysis using deseasonalized surface water pCO(2) data in portions of the North Atlantic, North and South Pacific and Southern Oceans (which cover about 27% of the global ocean areas) indicates that the surface water pCO(2) over these oceanic areas has increased on average at a mean rate of 1.5 mu atm y(-1) with basin-specific rates varying between 1.2 +/- 0.5 and 2.1 +/- 0.4 mu atm y(-1). A global ocean database for a single reference year 2000 is assembled using this mean rate for correcting observations made in different years to the reference year. The observations made during El Nino periods in the equatorial Pacific and those made in coastal zones are excluded from the database.\\n   Seasonal changes in the surface water pCO(2) and the sea-air pCO(2) difference over four climatic zones in the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian and Southern Oceans are presented. Over the Southern Ocean seasonal ice zone, the seasonality is complex. Although it cannot be thoroughly documented due to the limited extent of observations, seasonal changes in pCO(2) are approximated by using the data for under-ice waters during austral winter and those for the marginal ice and ice-free zones.\\n   The net air-sea CO2 flux is estimated using the sea-air pCO(2) difference and the air-sea gas transfer rate that is parameterized as a function of (wind speed)2 with a scaling factor of 0.26. This is estimated by inverting the bomb C-14 data using Ocean General Circulation models and the 1979-2005 NCEP-DOE AMIP-II Reanalysis (R-2) wind speed data. The equatorial Pacific (14 degrees N-14 degrees S) is the major source for atmospheric CO2, emitting about +0.48 Pg-C y(-1), and the temperate oceans between 14 degrees and 50 degrees in the both hemispheres are the major sink zones with an uptake flux of -0.70 Pg-C y(-1) for the northern and -1.05 Pg-C y(-1) for the southern zone. The high-latitude North Atlantic, including the Nordic Seas and portion of the Arctic Sea, is the most intense CO2 sink area on the basis of per unit area, with a mean of -2.5 tons-C month(-1) km(-2). This is due to the combination of the low pCO(2) in seawater and high gas exchange rates. In the ice-free zone of the Southern Ocean (50 degrees-62 degrees S), the mean annual flux is small (-0.06 Pg-C y(-1)) because of a cancellation of the summer uptake v flux with the winter release Of CO2 caused by deepwater upwelling. The annual mean for the contemporary net v uptake flux over the global oceans is estimated to be -1.6+/-0.9 Pg-C y(-1), which includes an undersampling correction to the direct estimate of -1.4+/-0.7 Pg-C y(-1). Taking the pre-industrial steady-state ocean source of 0.4+/-0.2 Pg-C y(-1) into account, the total ocean uptake flux including the anthropogenic CO2 is estimated to be -2.0+/- 1.0 Pg-C y(-1) in 2000.

Located within the California Current upwelling system, this open bay is strongly influenced by oceanographic dynamics resulting from cycles of upwelling favorable winds and their relaxation and/or reversal. Different wind forcing causes influx of different water types that originate outside the bay: cold nutrient-rich waters during upwelling and warm nutrient-poor waters during relaxation. In this study, we examine how the bay\\'s bloom incubation area can interact with highly variable circulation to cause red tide spreading, dispersal and retention. This examination of processes is supported by satellite, airborne and in situ observations of a major dinoflagellate bloom during August and September of 2004. Remote sensing of high spatial, temporal and spectral resolution shows that the bloom originated in the NE bay, where it was highly concentrated in a narrow band along a thermal front. Upwelling circulation rapidly spread part of the bloom, mixing cool waters of an upwelling filament with warm bloom source waters as they spread. Vertical migration of the dinoflagellate populations was mapped by autonomous underwater vehicle surveys through the spreading bloom. Following bloom expansion, a two-day wind reversal forced intrusion of warm offshore waters that dispersed much of the bloom. Upwelling winds then resumed, and the bloom was further dispersed by an influx of cold water. Throughout these oceanographic responses to changing winds, an intense bloom persisted in sheltered waters of the NE bay, where extreme blooms are most frequent and intense. Microscopic examination of surface phytoplankton samples from the central bay showed that spreading of the bloom from the NE bay and mixing with regional water masses resulted in significantly increased abundance of dinoflagellates and decreased abundance of diatoms. Similar dinoflagellate bloom incubation sites are indicated in other areas of the California Current system and other coastal upwelling systems. Through frequent bloom development and along-coast transports, relatively small incubation sites may significantly influence larger regions of the coastal marine ecosystems in which they reside.

Measurements showed an acceleration of the middepth flow as it moved toward the deepest part of the hollow, in contrast to the deceleration expected from two-dimensional Bernoulli-type dynamics. The acceleration was attributed to lateral water intrusions that were most apparent during floods, as corroborated by observations in a transverse section that crossed the deepest part of one of the hollows. The flow acceleration toward the deepest part of the hollows during flood, favored by lateral water intrusions, was deflected toward the right (looking landward) owing to Coriolis accelerations. In general, during ebb and flood, the dynamics over the hollows could be explained with three-dimensional Bernoulli-type dynamics (pressure gradient balanced by advection) modified by Coriolis acceleration. Outside the hollows, the dynamics were between pressure gradient and friction (stress divergence). The transition from frictionally dominated dynamics (outside the hollow) to advection-dominated dynamics (inside the hollow) appears at the region where the bathymetric slope equals the bottom drag coefficient.\\nC1 [Salas-Monreal, David] Univ Veracruzana, Ctr Ecol & Pesquerias, Boca Del Rio 94290, Veracruz, Mexico.\\n   [Valle-Levinson, Arnoldo] Univ Florida, Dept Civil & Coastal Engn, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.\\nRP Salas-Monreal, D (通讯作者)，Univ Veracruzana, Ctr Ecol & Pesquerias, Calle Hidalgo 617, Boca Del Rio 94290, Veracruz, Mexico.\\nEM davsalas@uv.mx; arnoldo@ufl.edu\\nFU NSF [OCE-9983685, OCE-0551923]; The Mexican National Science and\\n   Technology Commission (CONACyT) [51300, 59882]\\nFX The support of NSF under grants OCE-9983685 and OCE-0551923 is\\n   gratefully acknowledged.

Localized wave packet trajectories are obtained, the energy growth mechanisms occurring are identified, and the potential role of perturbation growth in wave breaking is assessed.\\n   Regarding meridional propagation, the wave packet motion is limited by turning levels where the waves are reflected and trapping levels where the waves stagnate. Regarding perturbation energy amplification, two growth mechanisms can be distinguished: growth due to advection of zonal velocity and growth due to downgradient Reynolds stresses. The three-dimensional perturbations producing optimal energy growth reveal that these two mechanisms produce large and robust amplification of zonal velocity and/or density and vertical velocity, potentially leading to shear or convective instability.\\n   For large static stability, amplification of density perturbations in conjunction with vertical orientation of the constant phase lines close to the trapping level potentially leads to a convective collapse of the wave packet near the trapping level, in agreement with existing direct numerical simulation studies. For lower static stability and for waves with phase lines oriented horizontally, growth due to advection of zonal velocity dominates, leading to rapid growth of streamwise streaks within the localized wave packet and potentially to shear instability.\\nC1 [Bakas, Nikolaos A.; Farrell, Brian F.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.\\nRP Bakas, NA (通讯作者)，Univ Athens, Off 32,Build 4, Athens 11528, Greece.\\nEM nikos.bakas@gmail.com\\nOI Bakas, Nikolaos/0000-0001-8222-6262\\nNR 27\\nTC 10\\nZ9 10\\nU1 0\\nU2 2\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA\\nSN 0022-3670\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

In the surf zone, fluid and suspended mud opposes water-wave movement and dissipates water-wave energy; on the beach, mud limits trafficability. As part of a multinational, multidisciplinary program to evaluate the influence of mud strength, density and viscosity on water-wave attenuation, sediments were evaluated in situ or collected for evaluation from an area offshore of Cassino Beach, slightly south of the Patos Lagoon mouth. Shear strength of deposited sediments ranged from 0.6 kPa at the seafloor to 3.4 kPa at similar to 1 m below the seafloor. Mud sediments were also collected to simulate the in situ response of fluid mud to shear stresses. For this determination, theological evaluations were made using a strain-controlled Couette viscometer on numerous remixed samples that ranged in density from 1.05 to 1.30 g/cm(3). it was determined that this mud is a non-ideal Bingham material in that it has a true initial yield stress as well as a upper Bingham yield stress. Initial yield stress ranged from 0.59 to 2.62 Pa, upper Bingham yield stress ranged from 1.05 to 7.6 Pa. Apparent viscosity ranged from 0.02 to 4.7 Pa s with the highest viscosities occurring between the two yield stresses. Sediment strength in the remixed samples is 2 to 3 orders of magnitude lower than the horizontal shear strength of the sediment bed as determined by shear vane or predicted from penetrometer measurements. This difference is partially due to the fact that rheological evaluations are made on fully remixed sediments, whereas horizontal shear strength is determined within relatively undisturbed sediments. Similar values of viscosity and shear strength are comparable to those determined for mud in other coastal areas where fluid mud deposits occur. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper addresses routing gliders to rapidly reach a specified waypoint or to maximize the ability to map a measured field, both in the presence of significant currents. For rapid transit in a frozen velocity field, direct minimization of travel time provides a trajectory \"ray\" equation. A simpler routing algorithm that requires less information is also discussed. Two approaches are developed to maximize the mapping ability, as measured by objective mapping error, of arrays of vehicles. In order to produce data sets that are readily interpretable, both approaches focus sampling near predetermined \"ideal tracks\" by measuring mapping skill only on those tracks, which are laid out with overall mapping skill in mind. One approach directly selects each vehicle\\'s headings to maximize instantaneous mapping skill integrated over the entire array. Because mapping skill decreases when measurements are clustered, this method automatically coordinates glider arrays to maintain spacing. A simpler method that relies on manual control for array coordination employs a first-order control loop to balance staying close to the ideal track and maintaining vehicle speed to maximize mapping skill. While the various techniques discussed help in dealing with the slow speed of gliders, nothing can keep performance from being degraded when current speeds are comparable to vehicle speed. This suggests that glider utility could be greatly enhanced by the ability to operate high speeds for short periods when currents are strong. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The model describes the transverse distribution of residual flows in tidally dominated estuaries. Scaling and perturbation techniques are used to obtain analytical solutions for residual flows over arbitrary across-channel bed profiles. The flows are induced by horizontal density gradients, tidal rectification processes, river discharge, wind, channel curvature and the earth\\'s rotation. These rectification processes induce residual flows that are up-estuary to the right and down-estuary to the left of an estuarine channel (looking up-estuary in the northern hemisphere). The tidal rectification processes fundamentally change the transverse structure of along-channel residual flows in many tidal estuaries, as these processes cause the flows to be internally asymmetric about the mid-axis of the channel for relatively large tidal velocities, steep channels or narrow estuaries. In addition, velocity scales are derived from the analytical solutions to estimate the relative importance of the various residual flow mechanisms from estuarine parameters. A case study of a transect across the Upper Chesapeake Bay showed that important features of the residual flow observed in that transect are reproduced and explained by the analytical model. The velocity scales were able to identify the relevant residual flow mechanisms as well. The tidal rectification processes considered here result from advection of along-channel tidal momentum by Coriolis-induced transverse tidal currents. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

We calculate winds at turbine hub height for the sea breeze compared with synoptic winds and, for each type of site, we compare the seasonal and daily phase match to electrical load. To improve large-scale ocean power resource calculations, we derive an iterative algorithm to determine the surface roughness coefficient (z(0)). Our method calculates z(0) for specific times and locations over the ocean, rather than the prior practice of using a generic z(0) that is constant across time and space. Due to lower surface roughness of the ocean, wind speeds are notably higher at hub height, so that in the MAB we find that a representative open shelf site has three times the power content of a nearby land site. Regarding phase match to daily electric load, we find the sea breeze adjacent to the coast is a very good match to this region\\'s electric power load profile. However, the open shelf wind speeds are so much higher (10.9 m s(-1) versus 5.7 m s(-1) for the comparison period) that the near-coast phase advantage is obviated. We also find more consistent wind power production offshore, with single sites producing at least some power 88 to 92% of the time. By modeling electrically interconnected sites, power production improves to 96.3% with as few as three interconnected wind sites and to 99.3% with 5 interconnected sites.\\nC1 [Garvine, Richard W.; Kempton, Willett] Univ Delaware, Coll Marine & Earth Studies, Newark, DE 19716 USA.\\n   [Kempton, Willett] Univ Delaware, Ctr Carbon Free Power Integrat, Newark, DE 19716 USA.\\nRP Kempton, W (通讯作者)，Univ Delaware, Coll Marine & Earth Studies, Newark, DE 19716 USA.\\nEM willett@udel.edu\\nRI Kempton, Willett M/H-5176-2012\\nOI Kempton, Willett M/0000-0002-7284-8954\\nNR 22\\nTC 15\\nZ9 15\\nU1 0\\nU2 7\\nPU SEARS FOUNDATION MARINE RESEARCH\\nPI NEW HAVEN\\nPA YALE UNIV, KLINE GEOLOGY LAB, 210 WHITNEY AVENUE, NEW HAVEN, CT\\n   06520-8109 USA\\nSN 0022-2402\\nEI 1543-9542\\nJ9 J MAR RES\\nJI J.

Munida is now an important prey for seabirds, mammals and coastal predatory fish. Knowledge of patterns of distribution and ecological niche of munida is scarce however off Peru. Here we describe and compare spatial patterns of distribution of anchoveta and munida and their ecological niches based on data from 26 acoustic surveys performed along the Peruvian coast between 1998 and 2006. The results indicate that munida and anchoveta share ecological niches but that munida is restricted to the coldest part of the productive cold coastal waters whereas anchoveta do not present any temperature preference over a large range (14-23 degrees C). The recent increase in munida abundance off Peru is concomitant with colder conditions; with their onset munida extended its range from central Chile northwards. Off Peru the very shallow oxycline keeps munida from its usual bottom habitat and has forced it to adopt pelagic behaviour. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The freshwater components of the equations are extracted from the recently released tabulated data of freshwater properties of Wagner and Prug [2002. The IAPWS formulation 1995 for the thermodynamic properties of ordinary water substance for general and scientific use. journal of Physical and Chemical Reference Data 31, 387-535]. The salt water component of the equation is based on the near-linear relationship between density, salinity and specific heat capacity and is extracted from the data sets of Feistel [2003. A new extended Gibbs thermodynamic potential of seawater. Progress in Oceanography 58, 43-114], Bromley et al. [1970. Heat capacities and enthalpies of sea salt solutions to 200 degrees C. journal of Chemical and Engineering Data 15, 246-253] and Grunberg [1970. Properties of sea water concentrates. In: Third International Symposium on Fresh Water from the Sea, vol. 1, pp. 31-39] in a temperature range 0-200 degrees C, practical salinity range 0-40, and varying pressure and is also calibrated by the data set of Millero et al. [1981. Summary of data treatment for the international high pressure equation of state for seawater. UNESCO Technical Papers in Marine Science 38, 99-192]. The freshwater and salt water components are combined to establish a workable multi-polynomial equation, whose coefficients were computed through standard linear regression analysis. The results obtained in this way for density, entropy and potential temperature are comparable with those of existing models, except that our new equations cover a wider temperature-(0-374 degrees C) than the traditional (0-40 degrees C) temperature range. One can apply these newly established equations to the calculation of in-situ or onboard density, specific volume (therefore, the porosity), and potential temperature change that are usually measured on shipboard by the Ocean Drilling Project (ODP) and other hydrothermal-fluid studies.

The lead was situated in first-year ice, in the transition zone between multiyear, and seasonal ice packs. We discuss the opening rate and shear of this lead in the context of weather system forcing of the Beaufort Sea sea ice. It is found that in an opening mode, the lead displays semidiurnal fluctuations in divergence. It was also observed that the lead predominately ridged first-year ice in closing. The volume of ice ridged was the same order of magnitude as ice growth within the study region during the time period studied. Further work is required to fully understand the implications of the subdiurnal forcing of the ice pack on deformation in the shear zone at the edge of the perennial ice pack in the Beaufort Sea. This study provides information about the temporal and spatial scales that must be resolved in these future investigations.\\nC1 [Hutchings, J. K.; Hibler, W.

A total of eight products, including observation-and model-based SST climatologies, are formed and compared with each other. Some of the observation-based SST data sets include only satellite measurements, while others combine in situ temperatures, such as those from moored and drifter buoys, with satellite data. Climatologies for numerical weather prediction (NWP) model-based data sets are formed using high temporal resolution (6 hourly) surface temperatures. Spatial resolution of these SST products varies greatly (approximate to 4 km to 280 km), with the observation-based climatologies typically finer than the NWP-based climatologies. In the interior, all data sets are in general agreement, with annual mean SST biases typically within +/- 0.2 degrees C in comparison to the finest resolution (4 km) satellite-based Pathfinder climatology. Major differences are near the land-sea boundaries where model-based SSTs pose serious biases (as much as > 5 degrees C). Such errors are due to improper contamination of surface temperatures over land since coarse resolution model-based products cannot distinguish land and sea near the coastal boundaries. A creeping sea-fill interpolation improves accuracy of coastal SSTs from NWP climatologies, such as European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast. All climatologies are also evaluated against historical in situ SSTs during 1942-2007. These comparisons confirm the relatively better accuracy of the observation-based climatologies.\\nC1 [Kara, A.

The eddy field and on-shelf nutrient flux below 50 m water depth were also investigated using a numerical model. The satellite-altimeter data analysis and numerical experiments indicated that the eddy field was induced by perturbations of the Bering Slope Current system and/or instabilities in the Bering Sea basin via flow through the Aleutian passes. The distribution of high primary production roughly coincided with the high variability area of the eddy field. Numerical experiments showed a 70% increase in net on-shelf flux and 54% increase in net on-shelf transport by the generation/propagation of eddies along the shelf break. At Pribilof Canyon, towed CTD/fluorometer measurements during the summer of 2003 revealed a stable water column and high fluorescence (>10 mu g L-1) in the area between the 200- and 1000-m isobaths at a time when there was a low level of on-shelf flux regardless of the eddy field. Conversely, the eddy-induced, on-shelf flux and stable water column can enhance primary production from spring to summer at the shelf break. Moreover, the eddy-induced on-shelf nutrient flux probably contributes to the primary productivity at the western shelf of the Pribilof Islands where the Bering Sea ecosystem is very dynamic. This eddy-related shelf break process can be applied to not only the Bering Sea shelf break but also all shelf break areas in which propagating eddies are found. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Wave heights and radiation stresses at the outer edge of the surfzone (water depth approximate to 2.5 m) varied by up to a factor of 4 and 16, respectively, over a 450 m alongshore distance, resulting in setup variations as large as 0.1 m along the shoreline (water depth approximate to 0.3 m). Even with this strong alongshore variability, wave-driven setup was dominated by the cross-shore gradient of the wave radiation stress, and setup observed in the surfzone is predicted well by a one-dimensional cross-shore momentum balance. Both cross-shore radiation stress gradients and alongshore setup gradients contributed to the alongshore flows observed in the inner surfzone when alongshore gradients in offshore wave heights were large, and a simplified alongshore momentum balance suggests that the large [O(1 kg/(s(2) m)] observed setup-induced pressure gradients can drive strong [O(1 m/s)] alongshore currents.\\nC1 [Apotsos, Alex; Raubenheimer, Britt; Elgar, Steve] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\n   [Guza, R.

This fresh water has three sources: Pacific water (relatively fresh cf. Atlantic water), river runoff, and sea ice meltwater. To determine the relative amounts of the three sources of fresh water, in May 2002 we collected water samples across the East Greenland Current in sections from 81.5 degrees N to the Irminger Sea south of Denmark Strait. We used nitrate-phosphate relationships to distinguish Pacific waters from Atlantic waters, salinity to obtain the sum of sea ice melt water and river runoff water, and total alkalinity to distinguish the latter. River runoff contributed the largest part of the total fresh water component, in some regions with some inventories exceeding 12 m. Pacific fresh water (Pacific source water S similar to 32 cf Atlantic source water S similar to 34.9) typically provided about 1/3 of the river runoff contribution. Sea ice meltwater was very nearly non-existent in the surface waters of all sections, likely at least in part as a result of the samples being collected before the onset of the melt season. The fresh water from the Arctic Ocean was strongly confined to near the Greenland coast. We thus conjecture that the main source of fresh water from the Arctic Ocean most strongly impacting deep convection in the Nordic Seas would be sea ice as opposed to fresh water in the liquid phase, i.e., river runoff, Pacific fresh water, and sea ice meltwater.

The authors find a seasonally modulated generation of EKE via baroclinic instability in modes with larger meridional length scales. Subsequent nonlinear eddy-eddy interactions redistribute the EKE to larger total horizontal length scales, and larger zonal scales in particular. This is confirmed by diagnosing the spectral transfer of EKE in the surface geostrophic flow, which is found to drive an anisotropic inverse cascade, being redirected in the sense consistent with the beta effect, as predicted by geostrophic turbulence theory on the beta plane.

AABW thickness generally decreases from south to north, modulated by ocean bathymetry. Likewise, NADW thickness generally decreases from north to south in the Atlantic Ocean. NADW dominates below the thermocline of the Atlantic Ocean at least as far south as the subtropical gyre of the South Atlantic, with a lesser, but still significant, influence around the entire Antarctic Circumpolar Current, in the Indian Ocean, and in the Pacific Ocean. However, in the Pacific and Indian oceans, AABW dominates below the thermocline. In addition, measurable quantities of AABW reach into the abyssal North Atlantic on both sides of the mid-Atlantic Ridge. The census results suggest that AABW occupies roughly twice the volume of NADW in the three main oceans, and that AABW is in contact with roughly twice the area of the deep main ocean floor compared with NADW. However, these results are somewhat sensitive to choices of water masses, their values of seawater properties, and the weightings of the seawater properties used in the analysis.\\nC1 NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.\\nRP Johnson, GC (通讯作者)，NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, 7600 Sand Point Way Bldg 3, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.\\nEM gregory.c.johnson@noaa.gov\\nRI Johnson, Gregory C/I-6559-2012\\nOI Johnson, Gregory C/0000-0002-8023-4020\\nNR 37\\nTC 201\\nZ9 206\\nU1 6\\nU2 40\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

Data from 34 U. S. cruises are publicly archived. They span the years 1975 to 2000, are equally distributed in spring and autumn, and cover roughly half the Arctic Ocean. The data set is strong: we use 2203 values of mean draft, each value averaged over a nominal length of 50 km. These values range from 0 to 6 m with a standard deviation of 0.99 m. Multiple regression is used to separate the interannual change, the annual cycle, and the spatial field. The solution gives a climatology for ice draft as a function of space and time. The residuals of the regression have a standard deviation of 0.46 m, slightly more than the observational error standard deviation of 0.38 m. The overall mean of the solution is 2.97 m. Annual mean ice draft declined from a peak of 3.42 m in 1980 to a minimum of 2.29 m in 2000, a decrease of 1.13 m (1.25 m in thickness). The steepest rate of decrease is -0.08 meters per year (m/a) in 1990. The rate slows to -0.007 m/a at the end of the record. The annual cycle has a maximum on 30 April and a peak-to-trough amplitude of 1.06 m (1.12 m in thickness). The spatial contour map of the temporal mean draft varies from a minimum draft of 2.2 m near Alaska to a maximum just over 4 m at the edge of the data release area 200 miles north of Ellesmere Island.\\nC1 [Rothrock, D.

Through a series of symposia, information on progress in addressing the key CCCC objectives on physical forcing, lower trophic level responses, higher trophic level responses and ecosystem interactions was exchanged among PICES member countries and scientists. Coupling of ecological and physical models was significantly advanced by CCCC, as evidenced by the wide use of and community acceptance of the NEMURO family of models of lower trophic level dynamics. Although significant progress on understanding the impact of climate variability, especially regime shifts, has been made within the CCCC Program, less progress was evident on other original objectives. Foremost among these were the lack of progress towards better documenting and understanding the carrying capacity of the North Pacific for key harvested fish species and an inability (so far) to provide quantitative and skillful forecasts of future ocean ecosystem conditions.

Marine survival rate was hypothesized to be determined during their early marine life stage, a time period corresponding to the first growing season after entering the marine environment while they are still in coastal waters. Based on the predictable relationships of C-13/C-12 ratios in food webs and the existence of regional C-13/C-12 gradients in organic carbon, C-13/C-12 ratios of early marine pink salmon were measured to test whether marine survival rate was related to food web processes. Year-to-year variation in marine survival rate was inversely correlated to C-13/C-12 ratios of early marine pink salmon, but with differences among hatcheries. The weakest relationship was for pink salmon from the hatchery without historic co-variation of marine survival rate with other PWS hatcheries or wild stocks. Year-toyear variation in C-13/C-12 ratio of early marine stage pink salmon in combination with regional spatial gradients of C-13/C-12 ratio measured in zooplankton suggested that marine survival was driven by carbon subsidies of oceanic origin (i.e., oceanic zooplankton). The 2001 pink salmon cohort had C-13/C-12 ratios that were very similar to those found for PWS carbon, i.e., when oceanic subsidies were inferred to be nil, and had the lowest marine survival rate (2.6%). Conversely, the 2002 cohort had the highest marine survival (9.7%) and the lowest mean C-13/C-12 ratio. These isotope patterns are consistent with hypotheses that oceanic zooplankton subsidies benefit salmon as food subsidies, or as alternate prey for salmon predators. Oceanic subsidies are manifestations of significant exchange of material between PWS and the Gulf of Alaska. Given that previously observed inter-decadal cycles of oceanic zooplankton abundance were climatically driven, exchange between PWS and the Gulf of Alaska may be an important process for effecting synoptic changes in marine populations of higher trophic levels, and thus an important consideration for climate-change models and scenarios.

This study goes beyond previous studies by including the possibility of modes with nonzero tilt in the alongfront direction, which allows for advection by the baroclinic frontal flow. This requires that the stability equations be solved numerically. The main example is based on observations of interleaving on the lower flank of Meddy Sharon, but a range of parameter values is covered, leading to conclusions that are relevant in a variety of oceanic regimes. The frontal zone is treated as infinitely wide with uniform gradients of temperature, salinity, and alongfront velocity. The stationary, vertically symmetric interleaving mode is shown to have maximum growth rate when its alongfront wavenumber is zero, providing validation for previous studies in which this property was assumed. Besides this, there exist two additional modes of instability: the ageostrophic Eady mode of baroclinic instability and a mode not previously identified. The new mode is oblique (i.e., it tilts in the alongfront direction), vertically asymmetric, and propagating. It is strongly dependent on boundary conditions, and its relevance in the ocean interior is uncertain as a result. Effects of variable diffusivity and buoyancy flux ratio are also considered.\\nC1 Oregon State Univ, Coll Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.\\nRP Smyth, WD (通讯作者)，Oregon State Univ, Coll Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.\\nEM smyth@coas.oregonstate.edu\\nNR 40\\nTC 12\\nZ9 12\\nU1 1\\nU2 6\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA\\nSN 0022-3670\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

Five cores yielded the following major deep-sea genera: Krithe, Henryhowella, Poseidonamicus, Legititnocythere, Pseudobosquetina, and Pennyella. All genera are widely distributed in abyssal depths in the world\\'s oceans and common in Cenozoic deep-sea sediments. The total number of ostracod specimens is higher and ostracod shell preservation is better near the sediment-water interface, especially at the 0-1 cm core depths. Core slices from similar to 5 to 10 cm were barren or yielded a few poorly preserved specimens. The DIVA2 cores show that deep-sea ostracod species inhabit corrosive bottom water near the carbonate compensation depth (CCD) even though their calcareous valves are rarely preserved as fossils in sediment cores due to postmortem dissolution. Their occurrence at great water depths may partially explain the well-known global distributions of major deep-sea taxa in the world\\'s oceans, although further expeditions using minimal-disturbance sampling devices are needed to fill geographic gaps.

The concentration and velocity data were collected with an Acoustic Backscattering System (ABS) and Acoustic Current Profiler (ACP) that were mounted on a bottom tripod. High-resolution bottom scanning sonar was also attached to the tripod to provide images of bed features during the experiment. Hourly time-averaged near-bed concentrations of suspended sediment were calculated from three models and compared with the measurements. Surface waves and currents that were generated by a storm of moderate intensity caused bed stresses that exceeded threshold stress for D-50 = 0.02 cm, the median size of the moderately well-sorted bottom sediment, over a period of about 7 days. Estimates of the concentration at 1 cm above the bottom, C-a1, were obtained using the ABS measurements. These observations have been compared with predictions for the concentration at 1 cm above the bottom, C-1. Nielsen\\'s models for reference concentration C-o [Nielsen, P., 1986.

C-1 calculated from this model compared well with measured C-a1, when currents were weak and small oscillatory ripples were observed in the sonar images. However, during the 3-day period of highest bottom stresses modeled C-1 did not compare well to C-a1. The other two models for C-1, Glenn and Grant [Glenn, S.M., Grant, W.D., 1987.

Delft Hydraulics Institute, The Netherlands.], accounted for combined wave-current stresses and included different formulations for predicting bedform scales. C-1 calculated from these models compared well with measurements throughout the early and middle period of the storm, but underpredicted measured values during the latter part of the experiment. An alternative method based on dimensional analysis provided a straightforward way to relate C-1 to bed stress and sediment parameters. This new relationship based on dimensional analysis explained about 77% of the variability in C-a1 derived from the ABS data. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The residual eddies are clearly related to the bend of the channel. For a channel bending toward the north, the residual eddy on the east side of the channel tends to be clockwise, and the residual eddy on the west side of the channel tends to be counterclockwise. Water in these tidal channels is mostly well mixed or weakly stratified. Motivated by these observations, an analytic model is developed to study tidally induced mean circulation in a curved channel with arbitrary depth variations. A sinusoidal channel is used to simulate the effect of curved channels. A series of experiments with different parameters have shown consistently that a pair of residual eddies around the curvature exists. By analyzing the model results, it is found that advection is a major contributor to the residual eddies. Although the pressure gradient and the nonlinear wave propagation may not be negligible, especially for long channels, it is the advection that generates the vorticity of the residual eddies. The conclusion is true for both short and long channels. Here the division between a short and long channel is 0.6 of a quarter of the tidal wavelength. In addition, we also analyzed results from a finite volume numerical model for Lake Pontchartrain, which has curved tidal channels. The results demonstrate similar residual eddies as shown by the analytical model and the observations.\\nC1 [Li, Chunyan] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.\\n   [Chen, Changsheng] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Marine Sci & Technol, New Bedford, MA 02744 USA.\\n   [Guadagnoli, Dominic] Dept Nat Resources, Coastal Resources Div, Brunswick, GA 31520 USA.\\n   [Georgiou, Ioannis Y.] Univ New Orleans, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, New Orleans, LA 70148 USA.\\nRP Li, CY (通讯作者)，Louisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.\\nRI Li, Chunyan/ABB-2765-2020\\nOI Li, Chunyan/0000-0003-2180-9784\\nNR 38\\nTC 42\\nZ9 43\\nU1 0\\nU2 14\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

A primary goal of the Southern Ocean GLOBEC program was to describe factors that contribute to the overwintering success of krill in this region. As part of this effort we conducted Video Plankton Recorder (VPR) surveys during austral fall and winter, 2001. The VPR survey yielded high-resolution distributions of larval krill, other plankton, and marine snow in relation to hydrography from a series of transect lines orthogonal to the coast on the continental shelf of the Western Antarctic Peninsula. Four taxa (larval krill, copepods, polychaetes, pteropods) and marine snow were numerous during fall; much lower abundances of all categories were present during winter, with only larval krill, copepods, and polychaetes present in any abundance. Distributions of plankton and marine snow were associated with water-mass types and the vertical structure of the environment, particularly for larval krill that were primarily associated with the pycnocline. During fall, larval krill were present across the entire shelf, with high abundances at the shelf break. Copepods were most numerous at depth during fall, consistent with ontogenetic migration to depth at the onset of winter. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Owing to the increasing human population and the expanding mariculture in the last two decades, the ecological environment has greatly changed with frequent harmful algal blooms. A monthly survey of water content, organic matter (TOM), and various forms of nitrogen and phosphorous in sediment from July 2002 to July 2003 in the bay was conducted. The results showed that the water content was correlated significantly with TOM and various form:5 of nitrogen and phosphorus and can be used as proxy for quick and rough estimate of these factors in the future surveys. TOM was also correlated significantly with various forms of nitrogen and phosphorus, indicating that it was one of the key factors affecting the concentrations and distributions of nitrogen and phosphorus in the investigated waters. Average total Kjeldhal nitrogen (TkN) content was(1113.1 +/- 382.5) mu g/g and average total phosphorus (TP) content was(567.2 +/- 223.3) mu g/g, and both were much higher than those of similar estuaries in China and elsewhere. Average nitrogen and phosphorus tended to be higher inside than outside the bay, higher at aquaculture than non-aquaculture areas, and higher at fish-cage culture than oyster culture areas, suggesting that large-scale mariculture inside the bay played an important role in the eutrophication of the Zhelin Bay. Various forms of nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were higher during the warm season (July-September), which was due to the increased decomposition and concentration of organic matter resulted from the fast growth and high mortality of the cultured species. Compared with July 2002, TkN and TP contents were much higher in July 2003, in consonance with the eutrophication of the Zhelin Bay. Because exchangeable phosphorus (Ex-P), iron-bounded phosphorus (Fe-P) and organic phosphorus (OP) combined accounted for 34.3% of the TP and authigenic phosphorus (Au-P) accounted for 49.2% of the TP, biological phosphorus (BP) that includes Ex-P, Fe-P, OP, and a portion of Au-P, thus accounted for 34.3% to 83.5% of the TP in the Zhelin Bay, which was within the percentage range, but with a high absolute value among the estuaries. Au-P was the most important species of phosphorus and accounted for 49.2% of the TP during the investigation. Since eutrophication in the water column can lead to reduction of pH in sediment and release of phosphorus in Au-P combined with authigenic spodiosite and calcium carbonate, high content of Au-P in the sediment maybe act as a time bomb that can trigger a vicious cycle of eutrophication and large-scale harmful algal bloom in the Zhelin Bay.\\nC1 [Dong Qiaoxiang; Lin Junda; Shang Xu; Li Jin; Huang Changjiang] Wenzhou Med Coll, Sch Environm Sci & Publ Hlth, Wenzhou 325035, Peoples R China.\\n   [Lin Junda] Florida Inst Technol, Melbourne, FL 32901 USA.\\nRP Huang, CJ (通讯作者)，Wenzhou Med Coll, Sch Environm Sci & Publ Hlth, Wenzhou 325035, Peoples R China.\\nEM cjhuang5711@163.com\\nRI Huang, Changjiang/F-2644-2010; Dong, Qiaoxiang/F-1918-2010\\nOI SHANG, XU/0000-0002-3998-8971; Dong, Qiaoxiang/0000-0003-4003-7919\\nNR 55\\nTC 8\\nZ9 10\\nU1 2\\nU2 17\\nPU SPRINGER\\nPI NEW YORK\\nPA 233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA\\nSN 0253-505X\\nEI 1869-1099\\nJ9 ACTA OCEANOL SIN\\nJI Acta Oceanol.

It is found that the circulation and its variability in the SSCS are dominated by the flow fields and eddies associated with the southward and northeastward wind-driven coastal jet separation from the coast of central Vietnam in the winter and summer, respectively. As a result of the coastal jet separation, cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies with strong flow variability are generated in the regions to the southeast of the Vietnam in the winter and to the east off central Vietnam in the summer. The separation of the wind-driven coastal jet is largely associated with the formation of adverse pressure gradient force over the shallow shelf topography around the coastal promontory off central Vietnam, balanced mainly by wind stress in the summer and by both wind stress and nonlinear advection in the winter. In the vorticity balance, a bottom pressure torque, the force exerted on the wind-driven current by the shelf topography, tends to yield an adverse vorticity favorable for the separation of coastal jet. The results suggest that the interaction between wind-driven coastal currents and shelf topography in the nearshore waters plays a crucial role in controlling the separation of the coastal jet.

It plays an important role in the carbon cycle in the Southern Ocean. To investigate the distributions of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and surface sea-water and its air-sea exchange rates in this region, the Chinese National Antarctic Research Expedition (CHINARE) had set up several sections in the Prydz Bay. Here we present the results from the CHINARE-XVI cruises were presented onboard R/V Xuelong from November 1999 to April 2000 and the main driving forces were discussed controlling the distributions of partial pressure of carbon dioxide. According to the partial pressure of carbon dioxide distributions, the Prydz Bay call be divided into the inside and outside regions. The partial pressure of carbon dioxide was low in the inside region but higher in the outside region (luring the measurement period. This distribution had a good negative correlation with the concentrations of chlorophyll-a in general, suggesting that the partial pressure of carbon dioxide was substantially affected by biological production. The results also indicate that the biological production is most likely the main driving force in the marginal ice zone in the Southern Ocean in summer. However, in the Antarctic divergence sector of the Prydz Bay (about 64 degrees S), the hydrological processes become the controlling factor as the sea surface partial pressure of carbon dioxide is much higher than the atmospheric one due to the upwelling of the high DIC CDW, and this made the outside of Prydz Bay a source of carbon dioxide. Oil the basis of the calculations, the CO, flux in January (austral summer) was -3.23 mmol/ (m(2) . d) in the inner part of Prydz Bay, i.e., a sink of atmospheric CO2, and was 0.62 mmol/(m(2) . d) in the outside part of the bay, a weak source of atmospheric CO2. The average air-sea flux of CO2 in the Prydz Bay was 2.50 mmol/ (m(2) . d).\\nC1 [Gao Zhongyong; Chen Liqi; Gao Yuan] State Ocean Adm, Inst Oceanog 3, Key Lab Global Change & Marine Atmospher Chem, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China.\\n   [Chen Liqi] Chinese Arctic & Antarctic Adm, Beijing 100860, Peoples R China.\\n   [Gao Yuan] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Newark, NJ 07102 USA.\\nRP Gao, ZY (通讯作者)，State Ocean Adm, Inst Oceanog 3, Key Lab Global Change & Marine Atmospher Chem, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China.\\nEM zgao@263.net\\nOI Chen, Long-Qing/0000-0003-3359-3781\\nNR 34\\nTC 7\\nZ9 18\\nU1 0\\nU2 10\\nPU SPRINGER\\nPI NEW YORK\\nPA ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES\\nSN 0253-505X\\nEI 1869-1099\\nJ9 ACTA OCEANOL SIN\\nJI Acta Oceanol.

Of particular focus are the interactions among largescale, mesoscale, and submesoscale processes. We first introduce the concept of scale window, and an orthogonal subspace decomposition technigue called multiscale window transform (MWT). Established on MWT is a rigorous formalism of multiscale transport, perfect transfer, and multiscale conversion, which makes a new methodology, multiscale energy and vorticity analysis (MS-EVA). A direct application of the MS-EVA is the development of a novel localized instability analysis, generalizing the classical notion of hydrodynamic instability to finite amplitude processes on irregularly variable domains. The theory is consistent with the analytical solutions of Eady\\'s model and Kuo\\'s model, the benchmark models of baroclinic instability and barotropic instability; it is further validated with a vortex shedding control problem. We have put it to application with a variety of complicated real ocean problems, which would be otherwise very difficult, if not impossible, to tackle. Briefly shown in this paper include the dynamical studies of a highly variable open ocean front, and a complex coastal ocean circulation. In the former, it is found that underlying the frontal meandering is a convective instability followed by an absolute instability, and correspondingly a rapid spatially amplifying mode locked into a temporally growing mode; in the latter, we see a real ocean example of how upwelling can be driven by winds through nonlinear instability, and how winds may excite the ocean via an avenue which is distinctly different from the classical paradigms. This system is mathematically rigorous, physically robust, and practically straightforward.\\nC1 Courant Inst Math Sci, New York, NY 10012 USA.\\nRP Liang, XS (通讯作者)，Courant Inst Math Sci, New York, NY 10012 USA.\\nEM san@deas.harvard.edu\\nNR 39\\nTC 0\\nZ9 0\\nU1 0\\nU2 7\\nPU SPRINGER\\nPI NEW YORK\\nPA 233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA\\nSN 0253-505X\\nEI 1869-1099\\nJ9 ACTA OCEANOL SIN\\nJI Acta Oceanol.

Four species of subthermocline-dwelling corals from 366 to 1680 m water depth were collected between 1964 and 2000 using dredge hauls. Carbonate directly underlying living polyps was analyzed for radiocarbon content. Corals underlying subantarctic waters to the south of the South Island and subtropical waters to the north of New Zealand were collected from 426 to 1680 m water depth and had Delta C-14 levels ranging from -11%. to -146%. (45-1200 C-14 years). These radiocarbon levels are in good agreement with the radiocarbon levels of the regional subthermocline waters, as determined for the Sigma CO2 in the waters by GEOSECS in 1974 and WOCE in 1992. The differences in Delta C-14 levels in corals sampled in the 1960s and 1990s trace a pattern of changing bomb radiocarbon influence on the carbon in subthermocline waters. The subtropical frontal zone, an area known for significant eddies and mesoscale mixing, sits astride the Chatham Rise to the east of New Zealand, and radiocarbon profiles there are correspondingly more complex. Corals collected on the Chatham Rise were retrieved from 366 to 1100 m and document Delta C-14 levels ranging from -116 parts per thousand to +12 parts per thousand (945 C-14 years before present to significantly bomb-influenced). Corals sampled from depths shallower than -500 m tended to have higher and more consistent levels of bomb-carbon input, whereas corals sampled from depths deeper than -800 m show little or no bomb-carbon influence. Published measurements of the radiocarbon levels of the dissolved inorganic carbon from a transect taken in 1988 across the Chatham Rise indicate localized injection of surface waters containing bomb radiocarbon to depths as great as 600 m, which appears to be faithfully recorded in the corals. These results indicate that deep corals record even decadal-scale changes in the radiocarbon signal of the water in which they grew, making them excellent recorders of deep-water radiocarbon past and present.

The West Florida Shelf is oligotrophic, yet populations > 10(6) cells L-1 frequently occur and blooms can persist for months. Here we examine the magnitude and variety of sources for N and P that are available to support blooms. Annual average in situ or background concentrations of inorganic N in the region where blooms occur range 0.02-0.2 mu M while inorganic P ranges 0.025-0.24 mu M. Such concentrations would be sufficient to support the growth of populations up to similar to 3 x 10(4) cells L-1 with at least a 1 d turnover rate. Organic N concentrations average 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than inorganic N, 8-14 mu M while organic P concentrations average 0.2-0.5 mu M. Concentrations of organic N are sufficient to support blooms > 10(5) cells L-1 but the extent to which this complex mixture of N species is utilizable is unknown. Other sources of nutrients included in our analysis are aerial deposition, estuarine flux, benthic flux, zooplankton excretion, N-2-fixation, and subsequent release of organic and inorganic N by Trichodesmium spp., and release of N and P from dead and decaying fish killed by the blooms. Inputs based on atmospheric deposition, benthic flux, and N-2-fixation, were minor contributors to the flux required to support growth of populations > 2.6 x 10(4) cells L-1. N and P from decaying fish could theoretically maintain populations at moderate concentrations but insufficient data on the flux and subsequent mixing rates does not allow us to calculate average values. Zooplankton excretion rates, based on measured zooplankton population estimates and excretion rates could also supply all of the N and P required to support populations of 10(5) and 10(6) cells L-1, respectively, but excretion is considered as \"regenerated\" nutrient input and can only maintain biomass rather than contribute to \"new\" biomass. The combined estuarine flux from Tampa Bay, Charlotte Harbor, and the Caloosahatchee River can supply a varying, but at times significant level of N and P to meet growth and photosynthesis requirements for populations of approximately 10(5) cells L-1 or below.

The theoretical framework is employed to investigate the ecological consequences of spatial patchiness in the density distribution of krill, which often assemble in swarms or schools. We first describe the formation of aggregations resulting from the interplay of social forces and population dynamics, and then consider an idealized ecosystem model of zooplankton with social behavior who feed on phytoplankton; this is solved analytically for the initial growth of patches and numerically for the steady-state distributions of predator and prey biomass. Environmental variability changes the linear instability criterion for spontaneous aggregation. The second part of the paper addresses the evolution of social behavior in a population with density-dependent mating success. The model simulates the transmission of a gene controlling social behavior; natural selection determines whether the grouping or non-grouping type becomes dominant. It is found that the behavior can evolve when mixing occurs rapidly enough for resources to remain available to the clustered organisms. Turbulent advection prevents the grouping type from becoming dominant if the shear of the flow is strong enough to disrupt the patches; otherwise the aggregated zooplankton benefit from enhanced diffusion of resources by the turbulent flow.

Most of the general circulation models use a simplified heat budget scheme based on Jerlov water types, and do not account for optical bottom effects. By optical bottom effect, we mean the bottom absorption and reflection of the short-wave radiation, which in turn affects the thermal stratification and heat exchange with the atmosphere. In this paper, this optical bottom effect is added to a 3D turbulence model (a 1D model called GOTM is coupled to a 3D model called POM) and the evolution of the temperature structure studied. We call the coupled model 3DGOTM. This optical bottom effect is found to be important in the areas with clear water, shallow depths and small solar zenith angle. On the basis of the coastal meteorological measurements from Andros Island, we have used this three-dimensional turbulence closure model (3DGOTM) to show the influence of bottom reflection and absorption on the sea surface temperature field. The final temperature of the developed water column depends on water depth and bottom albedo. Effects of varying the bottom albedo were studied by comparing results for coral sand and sea grass bottoms. This has an appreciable contribution to the heat budget and salt budget of the shallow waters in these coastal regions. The salinities of the shallow regions near Andros Island have been found to reach as high as 46 psu by summer. In addition to the thermohaline plumes generated by these bottom effects, this warming process has an impact on the moisture feedbacks into the atmosphere due to evaporation.\\nC1 [Warrior, Hari] Indian Inst Technol, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India.\\n   [Carder, Kendall] Univ S Florida, Dept Marine Sci, St Petersburg, FL 33705 USA.\\nRP Warrior, H (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Technol, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India.\\nEM warrior@naval.iitkgp.ernet.in\\nNR 34\\nTC 2\\nZ9 2\\nU1 0\\nU2 4\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

The strength of the spring bloom in the MBS varies dramatically and the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. It has been hypothesized that the weak (or missing) 1998 spring bloom was due to increased zooplankton grazing pressure after a relatively warmer winter that led to earlier development of zooplankton populations. However, chlorophyll concentrations were low in the entire GOM region during the spring bloom period of 1998. These low chlorophyll waters would enter the MBS by persistent intrusion from the GOM and affect the MBS spring bloom by reducing the accumulation of phytoplankton biomass, suggesting an alternative explanation for the missing bloom. In this study, the influences of the intruding GOM waters on the MBS spring bloom are examined using numerical simulations and observations to compare two contrasting spring blooms (a weak bloom in 1998 versus a strong bloom in 2000). The results indicate that intruding waters from the GOM significantly reduced the strength of spring bloom in 1998, but enhanced the spring bloom in 2000. A theoretical analysis suggests that the influence of the intrusion on the MBS spring bloom is mostly limited to the northern portion of the MBS, and the impact area is determined by local net growth, velocity of intruding flow and horizontal mixing. The intrusion of GOM waters carries the signal of long-term variability in the GOM region and thus may be an important oceanic pathway for climate changes to impact the MBS ecosystem.

These export fluxes were used in conjunction with rates of primary productivity and benthic carbon respiration to construct a POC budget for this shelf-slope region. Samples were collected along a series of shelf-basin transects in the spring ( May - June) and summer ( July - August) of 2004. These stations were previously occupied during the ice covered ( spring) and open water ( summer) seasons of 2002, allowing for an interannual comparison of export flux. In contrast to 2002, when open water POC fluxes were significantly higher than in the ice-covered period, POC export fluxes in 2004 were similar during the spring ( average = 19.7 +/- 24.8 mmol C m(-2) d(-1)) and summer ( average = 20.0 +/- 14.5 mmol C m(-2) d(-1)). The high POC fluxes measured during the spring are attributed to a plankton bloom, as evidenced by exceptionally high rates of primary productivity (average = 124.4 +/- 88.1 mmol C m(-2) d(-1)). The shelf-slope budget of particulate organic carbon indicates that 10 - 20% of primary productivity was exported below 50 m but was not consumed during benthic carbon respiration or burial and oxidation in underlying sediments. Furthermore, a water column - sediment budget of Th-234 indicates that particulate material is retained in shelf sediments on a seasonal basis.\\nC1 Univ Rhode Isl, Grad Sch Oceanog, Narragansett, RI 02882 USA.\\n   Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Phys, Dublin 4, Ireland.\\n   Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.\\n   USN, Postgrad Sch, Dept Oceanog, Monterey, CA 93943 USA.\\n   Old Dominion Univ, Ctr Coastal Phys Oceanog, Norfolk, VA 23508 USA.\\n   Bermuda Biol Stn Res, St Georges, Bermuda.\\n   Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USA.\\nRP Lepore, K (通讯作者)，Univ Rhode Isl, Grad Sch Oceanog, Narragansett, RI 02882 USA.\\nRI Cooper, Lee W./E-5251-2012; Kelly, Roger/E-9396-2010; Hansell, Dennis\\n   A./AAC-1271-2019; Grebmeier, Jacqueline/L-9805-2013\\nOI Cooper, Lee W./0000-0001-7734-8388; Hansell, Dennis\\n   A./0000-0001-9275-3445; Grebmeier, Jacqueline/0000-0001-7624-3568;\\n   Moran, Bradley/0000-0001-9263-2889\\nNR 71\\nTC 46\\nZ9 49\\nU1 2\\nU2 21\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

They occurred in 1925, 1939, 1946, 1976-1977, 1989 and 1999. The major change in 1976-1977 corresponds to a regime shift that is now widely accepted as a canonical event since it had a significant impact on virtually all climatic and ecosystem indicators. We seek to determine if daily sea surface temperature (SST) from Pacific Grove, in central California, and Scripps Pier, in southern California, and coastal observations from several other locations along the west coast of North America can be used to detect and resolve these events. Cumulative sums (CUSUMs) were initially calculated to enhance the detection process. The CUSUM trajectories during the 1976-1977 event at Pacific Grove and Scripps Pier were distinctive, highly correlated, and in phase. The turning point patterns from this event were then used to search for other events that have been reported since 1920. Turning point patterns very similar to the 1976-1977 event were detected in 1946 and 1989. The events in 1925 and 1939 were generally similar, but the CUSUM patterns for the event in 1999 departed significantly from the other events. Further examination of the 1976 and 1989 events revealed inflection points in the CUSUMs near the beginning and end of each transition that correspond to critical values or extrema in the original data. The inflection points and/or critical values provide an improved basis for determining the duration of these events.\\n   The robustness of the CUSUM approach for detecting regime shifts was examined by posing the inverse problem to determine if other possible regime changes could be detected that have not been previously reported. The period between 1946 and 1976 was examined, and one match in 1972 was found, which coincided with a large shift in the Aleutian Low Pressure Index. The CUSUM patterns associated with well-defined regime shifts may be essentially unique and thus useful in searching for other events. Whether the temperature ultimately increases or decreases following a regime shift is well-predicted by the sign of the CUSUM slope during an event. Testing regime shifts for statistical significance may be problematic, but our results suggest that when CUSUMs are employed, the detection problem becomes one that is more closely related to pattern recognition where other tests could be applied.\\n   CUSUMs often produce a distinct pattern that appears to be characteristic of regime shifts. During well-defined events such as those that occurred in 1946, 1976, and 1989, the CUSUM trajectories from Pacific Grove and Scripps Pier were highly synchronized and nearly identical in form. The CUSUM transformation allows us to identify, localize and observe how these events evolve. We have only been able to examine these events in such detail because daily observations from single locations were used. Based on the events we have examined, they have time scales that range from about 4-9 months. Salinity and sea level data were also employed in this study and were found to be less sensitive to the changes associated with regime shifts than SST. Regime shifts detected in CUSUMs of SST at two locations off Vancouver Island were found to be weaker in amplitude and less well-defined than those detected at Pacific Grove and Scripps Pier. However, they were in phase with the events observed further south. Establishing the connection between these results, and changes in the ecosystems of the North Pacific, should be given a high priority. Finally, the results of this study are related to decadal climate variability and provide additional insight into the nature of this phenomenon. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Over 700 synoptic sections are used to construct a mean three-dimensional description of the summer shelfbreak front and to quantify the along-stream evolution in properties, including frontal strength and grounding position. Results show that there are actually two fronts in the northern part of the domain - a shallow front located near the shelf break and a deeper front centered in the core of Irminger Water over the upper slope. The properties of the deeper Irminger front erode gradually to the south, and the front disappears entirely near the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. The shallow shelfbreak front is identifiable throughout the domain, and its properties exhibit large variations from north to south, with the largest changes occurring near the Tail of the Grand Banks. Despite these structural changes, and large variations in topography, the foot of the shelfbreak front remains within 20 km of the shelf break. The hydrographic sections are also used to examine the evolution of the baroclinic velocity field and its associated volume transport. The baroclinic velocity structure consists of a single velocity core that is stronger and penetrates deeper where the Irminger front is present. The baroclinic volume transport decreases by equal amounts at the southern end of the Labrador Shelf and at the Tail of the Grand Banks. Overall, the results suggest that the Grand Banks is a geographically critical location in the North Atlantic shelfbreak system.\\nC1 Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Phys Oceanog, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\nRP Fratantoni, PS (通讯作者)，Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Phys Oceanog, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\nEM pfratantoni@whoi.edu\\nNR 54\\nTC 82\\nZ9 83\\nU1 0\\nU2 16\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA\\nSN 0022-3670\\nEI 1520-0485\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

Yet, the distribution, status, and ecological roles of deep (> 30 in) Caribbean reefs are not well known. In this report, an observation of a deep reef which has undergone a recent extensive loss of coral cover is presented.

Long time series of coastal sea level and wind stress are used to show that while upwelling favorable winds have been more persistent since 1982, ENSO events ( i) are largely driven by signals from the west Pacific Ocean shelf/slope waveguide and not local meteorological conditions, ( ii) can account for 10-cm changes in sea level, and ( iii) together with wind stress, explain 62% of the variance of annual-averaged sea level. Thus, both local winds and remote forcing from the west Pacific are likely important to the low-frequency shelf edge circulation. Evidence also suggests that, since 1983, wintertime downwelling during the onset of an El Nino is reduced and the following summertime upwelling is enhanced. In situ data show that during the 1998 and 2003 El Nino events anomalously cold ( 10.5 degrees - 11.5 degrees C) water is found at depths of 60 - 120 m and is more than two standard deviations cooler than the mean. A regression showed that averaged sea level can provide a statistically significant proxy for these subsurface temperature changes and indicates a 2.2 degrees C decrease in temperature for the 10-cm decrease in sea level that was driven by the 1998 El Nino event. Limited current-meter observations, long sea level records, and output from a global ocean model were also examined and provide support for the hypothesis that El Nino events substantially reduce wintertime ( but not summertime) shelf-edge currents. Further research to confirm this asymmetric response and its cause is required.\\nC1 Aquat Sci Ctr, Henley Beach, SA 5024, Australia.\\n   S Australian Res & Dev Inst, W Beach, SA, Australia.\\n   Univ New S Wales, Sch Math, Sydney, NSW, Australia.\\n   Univ Adelaide, Sch Math, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.\\n   Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.\\n   Los Alamos Natl Lab, Los Alamos, NM USA.\\n   Deakin Univ, Warrnambool, Vic, Australia.\\nRP Middleton, JF (通讯作者)，Aquat Sci Ctr, POB 120, Henley Beach, SA 5024, Australia.\\nEM middleton.john@saugov.sa.gov.au\\nOI Ward, Timothy Mark/0000-0002-9003-2772\\nNR 28\\nTC 36\\nZ9 38\\nU1 1\\nU2 20\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA\\nSN 0022-3670\\nEI 1520-0485\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

To assess the dominant timescales of variability, a wavelet analysis is applied to almost nine years (October 1997 to July 2006) of 1-km-resolution, 5-day-averaged, Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) chlorophyll a (chl a) concentration data. The dominant periods of chlorophyll variance, and how these change in time, are quantified as a function of distance offshore. The maximum variance in chlorophyll occurs with a period of similar to 100-200 days. A seasonal cycle in the timing of peak variance is revealed, with maxima in spring/summer close to shore (20 km) and in autumn/winter 200 km offshore. Interannual variability in the magnitude of chlorophyll variance shows maxima in 1999, 2001, 2002, and 2005. There is a very strong out-of-phase correspondence between the time series of chlorophyll variance and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index. We hypothesize that positive PDO conditions, which reflect weak winds and poor upwelling conditions, result in reduced mesoscale variability in the coastal region, and a subsequent decrease in chlorophyll variance. Although the chlorophyll variance responds to basin-scale forcing, chlorophyll biomass does not necessarily correspond to the phase of the PDO, suggesting that it is influenced more by local-scale processes. The mesoscale variability in the system may be as important as the chl a biomass in determining the potential productivity of higher trophic levels.\\nC1 Univ Maine, Sch Marine Sci, Orono, ME 04469 USA.\\nRP Henson, SA (通讯作者)，Univ Maine, Sch Marine Sci, Orono, ME 04469 USA.\\nRI Henson, Stephanie/AAC-9709-2019\\nOI Henson, Stephanie/0000-0002-3875-6802\\nNR 80\\nTC 24\\nZ9 24\\nU1 0\\nU2 4\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

With bandpass filtering, the calculation is performed for the semidiurnal band ( emphasizing M-2 internal tides, generated by flow over sloping topography) and for the near-inertial band ( emphasizing wind-generated waves near the Coriolis frequency). The time dependence of semidiurnal E and F is first examined at six locations north of the Hawaiian Ridge; E and F typically rise and fall together and can vary by over an order of magnitude at each site. This variability typically has a strong spring-neap component, in addition to longer time scales. The observed spring tides at sites northwest of the Hawaiian Ridge are coherent with barotropic forcing at the ridge, but lagged by times consistent with travel at the theoretical mode-1 group speed from the ridge. Phase computed from 14-day windows varies by approximately +/- 45 degrees on monthly time scales, implying refraction by mesoscale currents and stratification. This refraction also causes the bulk of internal-tide energy flux to be undetectable by altimetry and other long-term harmonic-analysis techniques. As found previously, the mean flux in both frequency bands is O(1 kW m(-1)), sufficient to radiate a substantial fraction of energy far from each source. Tidal flux is generally away from regions of strong topography. Near-inertial flux is overwhelmingly equatorward, as required for waves generated at the inertial frequency on a beta plane, and is winter-enhanced, consistent with storm generation. In a companion paper, the group velocity, (c) over cap (g) equivalent to FE-1, is examined for both frequency bands.\\nC1 Univ Washington, Appl Phys Lab, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.\\n   Univ Washington, Sch Oceanog, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.\\nRP Alford, MH (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Appl Phys Lab, 1013 NE 40th St, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.\\nEM malford@apl.washington.edu\\nRI Zhao, Zhongxiang/A-1918-2012\\nOI Zhao, Zhongxiang/0000-0002-5897-089X\\nNR 53\\nTC 79\\nZ9 79\\nU1 1\\nU2 15\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA\\nSN 0022-3670\\nEI 1520-0485\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

The unconstrained simulation exhibits considerable skill in replicating the observed interannual variability in vertically integrated heat content estimated from hydrographic data and monthly satellite sea surface temperature and sea surface height data. Globally, the most significant interannual variability modes arise from El Nino-Southern Oscillation and the Indian Ocean zonal mode, with substantial extension beyond the Tropics into the midlatitudes. In the well-stratified Tropics and subtropics, net annual heat storage variability is driven predominately by the convergence of the advective heat transport, mostly reflecting velocity anomalies times the mean temperature field. Vertical velocity variability is caused by remote wind forcing, and subsurface temperature anomalies are governed mostly by isopycnal displacements ( heave). The dynamics at mid-to high latitudes are qualitatively different and vary regionally. Interannual temperature variability is more coherent with depth because of deep winter mixing and variations in western boundary currents and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current that span the upper thermocline. Net annual heat storage variability is forced by a mixture of local air-sea heat fluxes and the convergence of the advective heat transport, the latter resulting from both velocity and temperature anomalies. Also, density-compensated temperature changes on isopycnal surfaces ( spice) are quantitatively significant.\\nC1 Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Marine Chem & Geochem, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\n   Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Climate & Global Dynam Div, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.\\n   Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Los Angeles, CA USA.\\nRP Doney, SC (通讯作者)，Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Marine Chem & Geochem, 266 Woods Hole Rd, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\nEM sdoney@whoi.edu\\nRI Doney, Scott C/F-9247-2010\\nOI Doney, Scott C/0000-0002-3683-2437; Danabasoglu,\\n   Gokhan/0000-0003-4676-2732\\nNR 59\\nTC 62\\nZ9 64\\nU1 0\\nU2 13\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA\\nSN 0022-3670\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

The NCOM-based model of the Monterey Bay area is evaluated during a series of upwelling and relaxation wind events in August-September of 2000. The model receives open boundary conditions from a regional NCOM implementation of the California Current System and surface fluxes from the Navy Coupled Ocean/Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System (COAMPS(TM))(COAMPS is a registered trademark of the Naval Research Laboratory). Issues investigated in this study are: NCOM-based model simulations of upwelling and relaxation events, coupling to COAMPS, use of sigma versus hybrid (sigma-z) vertical grids, and coupling with a larger-scale model on the open boundaries. The NCOM simulations were able to reproduce the observed sequence of the upwelling and relaxation events, which can be attributed, in part, to the good agreement between the observed and COAMPS winds. Comparisons with the mooring observations show that COAMPS overestimates shortwave radiation values, which makes the NCOM modeled SSTs too warm in comparison with observations. The NCOM runs forced with different resolution atmospheric forcing (3 versus 9 km) do not show significant differences in the predicted SSTs and mixed-layer depths at the mooring locations. At the same time, during the extended upwelling event, the model runs forced with 3 and 9 km resolution COAMPS fields show differences in the surface circulation patterns, which are the most distinct in the southern portion of the model domain. The model run with 9-km forcing develops a northward flow along the coast, which is not present in the run with 3-km forcing and in observations (for example, HF radar-derived radials). Comparison of the wind patterns of the 3- and 9-km products shows a weakening of the 9-km wind stress along the southern coast of the NCOM model domain, which is responsible for the development of the artificial northward flow in the NCOM run with 9-km forcing.\\nC1 USN, Res Lab, Div Oceanog, Stennis Space Ctr, MS 39529 USA.\\n   Jacobs Sverdrup, Stennis Space Ctr, MS 39529 USA.\\n   Naval Res Lab, Marine Meteorol Div, Monterey, CA 93943 USA.\\n   Monterey Bay Aquarium Res Inst, Moss Landing, CA USA.\\n   USN, Postgrad Sch, Dept Oceanog, Monterey, CA 93943 USA.\\nRP Shulman, I (通讯作者)，USN, Res Lab, Div Oceanog, Stennis Space Ctr, MS 39529 USA.\\nEM igor.shulman@nrlssc.navy.mil\\nNR 24\\nTC 31\\nZ9 31\\nU1 0\\nU2 6\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

The model includes tides and wind- and buoyancy-induced flows. In the upper Inlet, the model successfully simulates large amplification of tides and propagation of fast (3 similar to 4 m s(-1)) tidal bores over shallow mudflats. The simulated return flows during ebb expose large areas (similar to 100 km(2)) of the mudflats. Medium-resolution (250- and 500-m) images obtained from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments aboard the Terra and Aqua satellites were used to verify the model results by identifying the location, extent, and temporal changes of the exposed mudflat regions. The results demonstrate the value of operational, medium-resolution remote sensing data in evaluating the WAD model. Sensitivity tests show that WAD produces approximately 20% larger tidal amplitude and 10% slower phase than the corresponding experiment without WAD. In the deep channel of the central Inlet, the confluence of saline water of the lower Inlet with brackish water from rivers and melting ice from land around the upper Inlet produces a salinity front. At the simulated front, strong vertical circulation cells and surface convergence and currents develop, especially during the flood. The characteristics resemble those of \"rip tides\" often observed in this region.\\nC1 Old Dominion Univ, Dept Ocean Earth & Atmospher Sci, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA.\\n   Princeton Univ, Program Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.\\n   Univ S Florida, Ctr Marine Sci, Inst Marine Remote Sensing, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA.\\nRP Ezer, T (通讯作者)，Old Dominion Univ, Dept Ocean Earth & Atmospher Sci, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA.\\nEM ezer@splash.princeton.edu\\nRI hu, chuanmin/J-5021-2012\\nOI Ezer, Tal/0000-0002-2018-6071\\nNR 45\\nTC 37\\nZ9 39\\nU1 0\\nU2 15\\nPU SPRINGER HEIDELBERG\\nPI HEIDELBERG\\nPA TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY\\nSN 1616-7341\\nEI 1616-7228\\nJ9 OCEAN DYNAM\\nJI Ocean Dyn.\\nPD JUN\\nPY 2007\\nVL 57\\nIS 3\\nBP 205\\nEP 221\\nDI 10.1007/s10236-007-0103-8\\nPG 17\\nWC Oceanography\\nWE Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)\\nSC Oceanography\\nGA 184QM\\nUT WOS:000247656800005\\nDA 2022-06-16\\nER\\n\\nPT J\\nAU Mahoney, A\\n   Eicken, H\\n   Gaylord, AG\\n   Shapiro, L\\nAF Mahoney, Andy\\n   Eicken, Hajo\\n   Gaylord, Allison Graves\\n   Shapiro, Lewis\\nTI Alaska landfast sea ice: Links with bathymetry and atmospheric\\n   circulation\\nSO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS\\nLA English\\nDT Article\\nID SHORE-FAST ICE; BEAUFORT SEA; ZONATION; OCEAN; SHEBA; EDGE\\nAB [ 1] Using Radarsat Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery of northern Alaska and northwestern Canada, we calculated a mean climatology of the annual landfast ice cycle for the period 1996 - 2004. We also present the monthly minimum, mean, and maximum landfast ice extents throughout the study area. These data reveal where and when the landfast is most stable and which sections of the coast are susceptible to midseason breakout events. Stabilization of landfast ice is strongly related to the advance of the seaward landfast ice edge (SLIE) into waters around 18 m deep. Isobaths near this depth are a good approximation for midseason landfast ice extent. Comparison with work from the 1970s suggests a reduced presence of landfast ice in this region of the Arctic, due to later formation and earlier breakup. This will likely lead to an increase in coastal erosion and may also have profound effects upon subsistence activities, which are intimately linked to the timing of marine mammal migration patterns. Interannually, landfast ice formation correlates with the incursion of pack ice into coastal waters, suggesting that the later mean date of formation in recent years may be related to the increasingly northward location of the perennial sea ice edge. The timing of breakup correlates well with onset of thawing air temperatures.

The instruments with which the authors have the most experience are the Aanderaa RCM11 and the Nortek Aquadopp, which measure currents using the Doppler shift of backscattered acoustic signals, and the Falmouth Scientific ACM, which measures changes in travel time of acoustic signals between pairs of transducers. Some results from the Doppler-based Sontek Argonaut and the travel-time-based Nobska MAVS are also reported. This paper concentrates on the fidelity of the speed measurement but also presents some results related to the accuracy of the direction measurement. Two procedures were used to compare the instruments. In one, different instruments were placed close to one another on three different deep-ocean moorings. These tests showed that the RCM11 measures consistently lower speeds than either a vector averaging current meter or a vector measuring current meter, both more traditional instruments with mechanical velocity sensors. The Aquadopp in use at the time, but since updated to address accuracy problems in low scattering environments, was biased high. A second means of testing involved comparing the appropriate velocity component of each instrument with the rate of change of pressure when they were lowered from a ship. Results from this procedure revealed no depth dependence or measurable bias in the RCM11 data, but did show biases in both the Aquadopp and Argonaut Doppler-based instruments that resulted from low signal-to-noise ratios in the clear, low scattering conditions beneath the thermocline. Improvements in the design of the latest Aquadopp have reduced this bias to a level that is not significant.\\nC1 Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\nRP Hogg, NG (通讯作者)，Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, MS 21, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\nEM nhogg@whoi.edu\\nNR 8\\nTC 22\\nZ9 22\\nU1 1\\nU2 6\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA\\nSN 0022-3670\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

Fish distributions in Barnabus Trough, off the east coast of Kodiak Island, were assessed using acoustic data collected with a calibrated echosounder during August September 2002 and 2004. Trawl hauls were conducted to determine the species composition of the fish making up the acoustic backscatter. Oceanographic data were collected from moorings, conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) probes, trawl-mounted microbathythermographs (MBT) and expendable bathythermographs (XBT). National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis data were used to assess area winds, and information on regional transport was derived from current meters deployed on moorings north and south of Kodiak Island. The distribution of water-mass properties and fish during 2002 showed variability at the temporal scale of weeks. Juvenile pollock (age-1 and age-2) were initially most abundant in warm, low-salinity water on the inner shelf, whereas capelin were distributed primarily on the outer shelf in cool, high-salinity waters. During a 2-week period juvenile pollock distribution expanded with the offshore expansion of warm, low-salinity water, and capelin abundance in outer-shelf waters decreased. We hypothesize that wind-driven pulsing of the ACC resulted in increased transport of warm, low-salinity water through the study area. In 2004, warm, low-salinity water characterized the inner shelf and cool, high-salinity water was found on the outer shelf. However, the distribution of water-mass properties did not show the weekly scale variability observed in 2002. Area winds were consistently toward the southwest during 2004, such that we would not expect to see the wind-driven pulsing of ACC water that occurred in 2002. Age-1 and age-2 pollock were not observed in Barnabus Trough in 2004. Instead, the midwater acoustic backscatter was composed of capelin mixed with age-0 pollock, and these capelin were not restricted to the outer-shelf waters, but were found primarily in warm, low-salinity inner-shelf waters that had been previously occupied exclusively by age-1 and age-2 pollock. We suggest that this is consistent with inner-shelf waters being preferred foraging habitat for juvenile pollock and capelin. Further study of the mechanisms linking climate change with variability in the ACC is needed, as are studies of the potential for competition between juvenile pollock and capelin.

Ratios of REE:Al2O3 suggest two sources-seawater and terrigenous debris. The seawater-derived marine fraction identifies bottom water in the Phosphoria Sea as O-2-depleted, denitrifying (suboxic) most of the time, and seldom sulfate-reducing (anoxic). This interpretation is supported by earlier research that showed progressively greater ratios in the marine sediment fraction of Cr:Ni > V:Ni >> Mo:Ni, relative to their ratios in seawater; for which marine Cr, V, and Mo can have a dominantly O-2-depleted bottom-water source and Ni a photic-zone, largely algal, source. The water chemistry was maintained by a balance between bacterial oxidation of organic matter settling through the water column, determined largely by primary productivity in the photic zone, and the flux of oxidants into the bottom water via advection of seawater from the open ocean.\\n   Samples strongly enriched in carbonate fluorapatite, the dominant REE host mineral, have variable Er/Sm, Tm/Sm, and Yb/Sm ratios. Their distribution may represent greater advection of seawater between the Phosphoria Sea and open ocean during deposition of two ore zones than a center waste and greater upwelling of nutrient-enriched water into the photic zone. However, the mean rate of deposition of marine Ni, a trace nutrient of algae, and PO43-, a limiting nutrient, indicate that primary productivity was probably high throughout the depositional history. An alternative interpretation of the variable enrichments of Er, Tm, and Yb, relative to Sm, is that they may reflect temporally variable carbonate alkalinity of open-ocean seawater in Permian time.\\n   A more strongly negative Ce anomaly for all phosphatic units than the Ce anomaly of modern pelletal phosphate is further indicative of an elevated O-2 concentration in the Permo-Carboniferous open ocean, as proposed by others, in contrast to the depletion of O-2 in the bottom water of the Phosphoria Sea itself.\\n   The oceanographic conditions under which the deposit accumulated were likely similar to conditions under which many sedimentary phosphate deposits have accumulated and to conditions under which many black shales that are commonly phosphate poor have accumulated. A shortcoming of several earlier studies of these deposits has resulted from a failure to examine the marine fraction of elements separate from the terrigenous fraction. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

We estimated the spatial distributions and densities of age-0 walleye pollock in five nursery areas around the eastern Bering shelf in three successive years (1997-1999) from acoustic survey data. Concurrently, we calculated estimates of the spatial distribution of euphausiids, a major prey of age-0 walleye pollock, and estimates of spatial overlap of groundfish predators with the age-0 walleye pollock. The analyses showed that all nursery areas had low densities of age-0 walleye pollock in 1997, which ultimately produced the weakest adult year-class. In the intermediate year of 1998, age-0 densities were low to medium, and in 1999, which produced the strongest of the three adult year-classes, all nursery areas had medium to high age-0 walleye pollock densities. Euphausiid distributions had a consistently positive spatial relationship with age-0 walleye pollock. Groundfish predator density ratios were positively related to age-0 walleye pollock density when age-0 walleye pollock were displaced relatively northward. Our results suggest that abundance of age-0 walleye pollock, and hence of adult cohorts in the eastern Bering Sea, can be predictable from a concise set of indicators: the densities of age-0 walleye pollock at nursery areas in mid- to late-summer, their spatial relationship to euphausiids and groundfish predators, and the latitudinal trend of their distributions. The 3 years 1997-1999 had significant differences of physical conditions in the eastern Bering Sea, and represent an advantageous framework for testing these hypotheses. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

How the presence of canyon walls affects the local production and distribution of mixed fluid is an open question. These dynamics are addressed through rotating tank experiments which impose mixing at middepth at the closed end of a channel open to a larger body of water. Turbulence is generated in a linearly stratified fluid with initial buoyancy frequency N by means of a single bar oscillated with frequency omega. The mixed fluid quickly reaches a steady state height h similar to (omega/ N)(1/2) independent of the Coriolis frequency f and collapses into the channel interior. A small percentage of the fluid exported from the turbulent zone enters a boundary current. The bulk forms a cyclonic circulation in front of the bar. As the recirculation cell expands to fill the channel, it restricts horizontal entrainment into the turbulent zone. Mixed fluid flux decays with time as t-(1/2) and is dependent on the size of the mixing zone and the balance between turbulence, rotation, and stratification. The recirculation cell is confined within the channel, and export of mixed fluid into the basin is restricted to the weak boundary current. As horizontal entrainment is shut down, long-term production of mixed fluid relies more on vertical entrainment. However, the scalings indicate that short-term dynamics are the most applicable to oceanic conditions.\\nC1 Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Ocean & Resources Engn, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.\\n   Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\nRP Wells, JR (通讯作者)，Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Ocean & Resources Engn, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.\\nEM wellsjr@hawaii.edu\\nNR 32\\nTC 1\\nZ9 1\\nU1 0\\nU2 2\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

The model domain consists of a circular island 15 km in diameter in an ocean 300 m deep. We use prescribed density anomalies in an initially motionless ocean to produce highly energetic internal solitary waves; their subsequent propagation is subject to island perturbations with and without the effect of earth\\'s rotation. In addition to reflected waves, two wave branches pass around the island and reconnect behind it. Island perturbations to the first-mode and second-mode waves are qualitatively similar, but the latter is more profound because of the longer contact time and, in the presence of earth\\'s rotation, the scale compatibility between Rossby radius of the second baroclinic mode and the island diameter. Without earth\\'s rotation, reflected and diffracted waves are symmetrical relative to the longitudinal axis passing through the island center. With earth\\'s rotation, the current following the wave front veers to the right due to Coriolis deflection. For a westward propagating incoming wave, the deflection favors northward wave propagation in the region between the crossover point and the island, shifting the wave reconnection point behind the island northward. It also displaces the most visible part of the reflected waves to the southeast. In the presence of earth\\'s rotation, a second-mode incoming wave produces island-trapped internal Kelvin waves, which are visible after the passage of the wave front.\\nC1 Univ Maryland, Ctr Environm Sci, Horn Point Lab, Cambridge, MD 21613 USA.\\n   N Carolina State Univ, Dept Marine Earth & Atmospher Sci, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.\\n   No Taiwan Inst Sci & Technol, Ctr Gen Educ, Taipei 112, Taiwan.\\n   Chinese Naval Acad, Dept Marine Sci, Kaohsiung 813, Taiwan.\\nRP Chao, SY (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Ctr Environm Sci, Horn Point Lab, Cambridge, MD 21613 USA.\\nEM chao@hpl.umces.edu\\nOI Yang, Yiing-Jang/0000-0002-6637-9311\\nNR 16\\nTC 18\\nZ9 24\\nU1 0\\nU2 10\\nPU TERRA SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO\\nPI TOKYO\\nPA 2003 SANSEI JIYUGAOKA HAIMU, 5-27-19 OKUSAWA, SETAGAYA-KU, TOKYO,\\n   158-0083, JAPAN\\nSN 0916-8370\\nJ9 J OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

A suite of experiments is run using this modeling system, constructed by coupling a Navy Coastal Ocean Model simulation of the Gulf of Mexico to an atmospheric flux model. The modeling system is forced by wind fields produced from satellite scatterometer and atmospheric model wind data, and by numerical weather prediction air temperature data. The experiments are initialized from a data assimilative hindcast model run and then forced by surface fluxes with no assimilation for the time during which Hurricane Dennis impacted the region. Four experiments are run to aid in the analysis: one is forced by heat and momentum fluxes, one by only momentum fluxes, one by only heat fluxes, and one with no surface forcing. An equation describing the change in the upper ocean hurricane heat potential due to the storm is developed. Analysis of the model results show that surface heat fluxes are primarily responsible for widespread reduction (0.5 degrees-1.5 degrees C) of sea surface temperature over the inner West Florida Shelf 100-300 km away from the storm center. Momentum fluxes are responsible for stronger surface cooling (2 degrees C) near the center of the storm. The upper ocean heat loss near the storm center of more than 200 MJ/m(2) is primarily due to the vertical flux of thermal energy between the surface layer and deep ocean. Heat loss to the atmosphere during the storm\\'s passage is approximately 100-150 MJ/m(2). The upper ocean cooling is enhanced where the preexisting mixed layer is shallow, e.g., within a cyclonic circulation feature, although the heat flux to the atmosphere in these locations is markedly reduced.\\nC1 Florida State Univ, Ctr Ocean Atmospher Predict Studies, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.\\nRP Morey, SL (通讯作者)，Florida State Univ, Ctr Ocean Atmospher Predict Studies, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.\\nEM morey@coaps.fsu.edu\\nRI Dukhovskoy, Dmitry/I-9391-2017; Bourassa, Mark/Z-2428-2019\\nOI Dukhovskoy, Dmitry/0000-0002-9114-9796; Morey,\\n   Steven/0000-0002-6585-1688\\nNR 31\\nTC 32\\nZ9 34\\nU1 2\\nU2 11\\nPU SPRINGER HEIDELBERG\\nPI HEIDELBERG\\nPA TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY\\nSN 1616-7341\\nEI 1616-7228\\nJ9 OCEAN DYNAM\\nJI Ocean Dyn.\\nPD DEC\\nPY 2006\\nVL 56\\nIS 5-6\\nBP 594\\nEP 606\\nDI 10.1007/s10236-006-0085-y\\nPG 13\\nWC Oceanography\\nWE Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)\\nSC Oceanography\\nGA 121XI\\nUT WOS:000243189900017\\nDA 2022-06-16\\nER\\n\\nPT J\\nAU Jaeger, JM\\n   Nittrouer, CA\\nAF Jaeger, John M.\\n   Nittrouer, Charles A.\\nTI A quantitative examination of modern sedimentary lithofacies formation\\n   on the glacially influenced Gulf of Alaska continental shelf\\nSO CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH\\nLA English\\nDT Review\\nDE glacial-marine sedimentation; Gulf of Alaska; tracers; (234)Th; (210)Pb;\\n   (137)Cs; chlorophyll-alpha; X-radiography; lithofacies; bioturbation;\\n   wave resuspension\\nID BRANSFIELD STRAIT ANTARCTICA; ISLAND SOUND SEDIMENTS; PAPUA-NEW-GUINEA;\\n   NORTHERN CALIFORNIA; NORTHEASTERN GULF; CHLOROPHYLL-A; ADRIATIC SEA;\\n   SEISMIC STRATIGRAPHY; ACCUMULATION RATES; SUSPENDED-SEDIMENT\\nAB Continental-shelf lithofacies are described from a series of cores collected in the northern Gulf of Alaska, a high-energy paraglacial shelf experiencing rapid rates of sediment accumulation. Short-lived tracers ((234)Th and chlorophyll-a) indicate that during the annual peak in fluvial sediment input (summer), biologic sediment mixing coefficients in the surficial seabed are generally lower than other coastal environments (< 20 cm(2) yr(-1)) and mixing extends downward < 10 cm. (210)Pb geochronology indicates that sediment accumulation rates (time scales of 10-100 yr) are 0.1-3 cm yr(-1). The measured bioturbation and accumulation rates lead to predictions of moderate to bioturbated lithofacies, as observed. Primary depositional fabric is preferentially preserved where sediment accumulation rates > 2 cm yr(-1) and non-steady sediment deposition occurs. Depositional fabric is also observed in strata at 50-100 m water depths and is similar in appearance to beds that may form through deposition of wave-induced fluid-mud flows, which have been observed forming on other shelves with moderate to high wave energy. Five general lithofacies can be identified for the study area: inner-shelf sand facies, interbedded sandy mud facies, moderate-to-well-bioturbated mud facies, gravelly mud facies, and Tertiary bedrock facies. The moderate-to-well-bioturbated mud facies is a really dominant, representing over 50% of the shelf area, although roughly equal volumes (similar to 0.4 km(3)) of strata with some preservation of primary fabric are annually accumulating. Lithofacies on this paraglacial shelf generally resemble mid- and low-latitude allochthonous shelf strata to a much greater degree than Holocene glacimarine strata formed on shelves dominated by icebergs and floating ice shelves. Paraglacial strata may be differentiated from non-glacial shelf strata by lower organic carbon concentrations, a relatively lower degree of bioturbation, and increased preservation of primary depositional fabric.

The source of sediment is the Atchafalaya River, which has been delivering sediment to the coastal ocean since the 1940s. Researchers have suggested that the repeated passage of cold fronts during winter and early spring plays an important role in delivering sediment to the coast. A sediment-transport study on the Atchafalaya coast was conducted between October 1997 and March 2001, which included several field experiments in early March, the period of high discharge from the Atchafalaya and frequent cold-front activity. A combination of shipboard profiling and time-series measurements from a bottom tripod and array of wave sensors on the inner shelf has resulted in a data set that illustrates the mechanism of onshore transport. For a cold-front passage sampled in 2001, during pre-front conditions, sediment is resuspended and mixed throughout the water column, with transport rates onshore and to the west of 53 and 184 g s(-1) m(-1), respectively. Post-front conditions also result in onshore transport due to onshore flow (upwelling) in the lower meter of the water column and formation of a high-concentration bottom layer. Post-front onshore transport rates are 32 g s(-1) m(-1) and most of the transport occurs in the bottom meter of the water column. The repeated cycling of cold-front passages leads to a positive feedback with transport onshore during both pre- and post-front conditions, and effective attenuation of wave energy over the muddy inner shelf inhibits erosion at the coast. Thus, the chenier-plain coast is experiencing high progradation rates (up to 29 m yr(-1)), while most of the Gulf coast is eroding. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Height and velocity profiles are derived along with expressions for the radar-observed current velocities in terms of bathymetry and tsunami height and period. Simulated tsunami-gene rated radial current velocities are superimposed on typical maps of radial velocity generated by a Rutgers University HF radar system. A detection parameter is defined and plotted to quantify the progress of the tsunami, which is shown to be detectable well before its arrival at the coast.

The concentration and N-15/N-14 of the wintertime surface nitrate are very close to those of the subantarctic thermocline. The N-15/N-14 of nitrate in the surface increases sharply into the summer even though there is little seasonal change in nitrate concentration. There are two possible end-member explanations for this observation. First, there may be significant equatorward nitrate transport during the summer, including a supply from the Antarctic surface. Second, the isotope effect of algal nitrate assimilation may be higher than has been estimated elsewhere, for example, for the seasonal sea ice zone of the Antarctic. We use a simple geochemical box model of the SAZ surface mixed layer as it evolves over the course of the summer to simulate salinity, nitrate concentration, and the N-15/N-14 of nitrate and sinking N. Our results suggest that a significant portion ( similar to 30%) of the summertime SAZ nitrate is supplied from south of the Subantarctic Front and that N export is >= 3.5 mmol N m(-2) d(-1). Our approach also identifies the necessity of an isotope effect for nitrate assimilation in the SAZ of >= 7 parts per thousand and probably 8 - 9 parts per thousand. Comparison to laboratory results suggests that this relatively high isotope effect may result from light limitation of algal growth in the SAZ.\\nC1 Princeton Univ, Dept Geosci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.\\n   CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Antarct Climate & Ecosyst Cooperat Res Ctr, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.\\n   CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Wembley, WA 6913, Australia.\\nRP DiFiore, PJ (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Dept Geosci, Guyot Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.\\nEM pdifiore@princeton.edu\\nRI Sigman, Daniel M/A-2649-2008; Trull, Tom W/B-7028-2014\\nOI Sigman, Daniel M/0000-0002-7923-1973; \\nNR 77\\nTC 68\\nZ9 69\\nU1 3\\nU2 20\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

The model reproduces many conspicuous characteristics in the CCS, including: complex, filamentary, mesoscale surface features seen in the pigment and temperature from satellite imagery; wind-driven coastal upwelling at appropriate spatial and temporal scales; and the close correlation between prominent features seen in pigment and those in temperature observed by satellites (Abbott and Zion, 1985). Statistical estimates of the characteristic spatial scales of variability, as calculated from the coupled, nested model, agree with those previously estimated from satellite images (for both surface temperature and pigment (Denman and Abbott, 1988, 1994)). Model estimates of the characteristic temporal scales of variability, from decorrelation times, agree with those previously estimated from satellite images. Typical model decorrelation times lie between 2 and 4 days, in agreement with calculations from earlier sequences of (Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS) and advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR)) satellite images (Denman and Abbott, 1988, 1994).\\nC1 Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.\\n   Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Div Ocean & Climate Phys, Palisades, NY USA.\\n   Rutgers State Univ, Inst Marine & Coastal Sci, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USA.\\n   Univ Washington, Joint Inst Study Atmosphere & Ocean, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.\\nRP Powell, TM (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, VLSB Room 5048A, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.\\nEM zackp@berkeley.edu\\nOI Dobbins, Elizabeth/0000-0002-4014-977X\\nNR 67\\nTC 73\\nZ9 75\\nU1 0\\nU2 10\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

The mass and momentum fluxes associated with surface waves are closely linked to their Stokes drift. Both the variability of the Stokes drift and the corresponding response of the underlying flow are important in a wide range of contexts. Three methods are developed and implemented to evaluate Stokes drift from a recently gathered oceanic dataset, involving surface velocities measured continually over an area 1.5 km in radius by 45 degrees. The estimated Stokes drift varies significantly, in line with the occurrence of compact wave groups, resulting in highly intermittent maxima. One method also provides currents at a fixed level (Eulerian velocities). It is found that Eulerian counterflows occur that completely cancel the Stokes drift variations at the surface. Thus, the estimated Lagrangian surface flow has no discernable mean response to wave group passage. This response is larger than anticipated and is hard to reconcile with current theory.\\nC1 Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.\\nRP Smith, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Mail Stop 0213,9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.\\nEM jasmith@ucsd.edu\\nNR 60\\nTC 32\\nZ9 32\\nU1 0\\nU2 5\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA\\nSN 0022-3670\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

In this article, the capabilities of the LISST-ST instrument are studied. The instrument reports the suspended sediment concentration and the settling velocity for eight different size classes by measuring the sediment concentration at the bottom of a small settling column. The size resolution of the LISST-100 and LISST-ST instruments is studied. This study utilizes a new inversion algorithm to obtain the size distribution from the scattered light pattern. In addition, attention is directed to observed deviations in laboratory measurements that may affect the relative concentrations and the settling velocity estimations. These deviations are analyzed in terms of. sample mixing problems; deviations on the settling of a suspension from its ideal behavior; and the effect of the shape of natural particles on laser scattering compared to that of spheres. Results suggests, of these three points the difference in the light scattering by irregular particles compared to the scattering by spheres is the main source of deviation on the settling velocity estimations. Finally, practical recommendations are given in order to gain confidence in the instrument results. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The time evolution of the sensitivity patterns demonstrates the validity of the adjoint modeling approach over climatological time scales in coarse-resolution ocean models. Our objective is to identify the principle adjustment mechanisms through which the meridional overturning strength adapts to perturbations in wind and buoyancy forcing.

Mesozooplankton were also sampled with oblique net tows to 155 m depth. Vertical OPC profiles showed uniform total abundance in the upper mixed layer, usually > 45 m. OPC and net data agreed with respect to total abundance, size composition, abundance of individual size classes, and seasonal cycle of abundance. We found no evidence for significant contributions to OPC particle counts by diatom aggregates, Trichodesmium spp., or detritus. Variations in OPC estimates of abundance are well explained by diel behavior and seasonal cycles of species that dominate mesozooplankton abundance, of which 80% are copepods. The summer maximum in mesozooplankton abundance is due primarily to the increase of the six smallest OPC size classes (< 1.15 mm equivalent spherical diameter), dominated by 14 nonmigrating copepod species that account for more than 95% of average copepod abundance. Seasonal cycles of zooplankton egestion estimated from OPC measurements were highly correlated, and comparable in magnitude, with observed sinking flux measurements of both C and N. Sinking flux at the base of the euphotic zone was 0.67 and 0.77 mol C m(-2) yr(-1) and 81 and 87 mmol N m(-2) yr(-1), for 1995 and 1995, respectively. The potential contribution of mesozooplankton egestion in the mixed layer, based on OPC measurements, accounts for 95% and 90% of C and 86% and 81% of N, respectively.\\nC1 Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.\\n   Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Integrat Oceanog Div 0227, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.\\n   Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Coastal & Ocean Sci, Boston, MA 02125 USA.\\nRP Huntley, ME (通讯作者)，Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, POST 802, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.\\nEM mhuntley@hawaii.edu\\nNR 70\\nTC 8\\nZ9 9\\nU1 1\\nU2 9\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

This directional broadening contrasts with the narrowing observed seaward of the surf zone and predicted by Snell\\'s law for bathymetric refraction. Field-observed broadening was predicted by a new model for refraction of swell by lower-frequency (nominally 0.01 Hz) current and elevation fluctuations. The observations and the model suggest that refraction by the cross-shore currents of energetic shear waves contributed substantially to the observed broadening.\\nC1 Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.\\n   Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\n   Naval Postgrad Sch, Dept Oceanog, Monterey, CA USA.\\nRP Henderson, SM (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.\\nEM shenders@coast.ucsd.edu\\nNR 16\\nTC 9\\nZ9 9\\nU1 0\\nU2 2\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA\\nSN 0022-3670\\nEI 1520-0485\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

Calculations of the distribution of finite-time Lyapunov exponents (FTLEs) indicate that the stirring in this region is not uniform and stretching rates over 15 days vary from less than 0.02 day(-1) to over 0.3 day(-1). These variations occur at both small (similar to 10 km) and large (similar to 1000 km) scales and in both cases are linked to dynamical features of the flow. The small-scale variations are related to the characteristics of coherent vortex structures, and there are low FTLEs inside vortices and filaments of high FTLEs in strain-dominated regions surrounding these vortices. Regional variations in the stirring are closely related to variations in mesoscale activity and eddy kinetic energy (EKE). High values of mean FTLE occur in regions of high EKE (highest mean values of around 0.2 day(-1) occur in the East Australia Current separation region) whereas small values occur in regions with low EKE (mean values around 0.03 day(-1) in the east Tasman Sea). There is a compact relationship between the mean FTLEs and EKE, raising the possibility of using the easily calculated EKE to estimate the stirring. This possibility is even more intriguing because the FTLE distributions can be approximated, for the time scales considered here, by Weibull distributions with shape parameter equal to 1.6, which can be defined from the mean value alone.\\nC1 Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.\\n   Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Wellington, New Zealand.\\nRP Waugh, DW (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, 3400 N Charles St, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.\\nEM waugh@jhu.edu\\nRI Abraham, Edward R/D-7422-2011; Waugh, Darryn W/K-3688-2016\\nOI Abraham, Edward R/0000-0003-4490-6704; Waugh, Darryn\\n   W/0000-0001-7692-2798\\nNR 67\\nTC 69\\nZ9 71\\nU1 0\\nU2 11\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA\\nSN 0022-3670\\nEI 1520-0485\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

In this study, two types of ocean models are used, an ocean general circulation model (GCM) and a 11/2-layer model, to investigate processes by which changes in the midlatitude winds affect the equatorial stratification. Specifically, the influences of anomalous mode-water formation, Ekman pumping, and entrainment in the subpolar ocean are examined. The effects of a \"sponge layer\" adjacent to the northern boundary of the basin are also assessed. Solutions are forced by idealized zonal winds with strong or weak midlatitude westerlies, and they are found in rectangular basins that extend from the equator to 36 degrees N (small basin) or to 60 degrees N (large basin). In the GCM solutions, a prominent response to reduced winds is the thinning of the mixed layer in the northwestern region of the subtropical gyre, leading to less subduction of low-potential-vorticity mode water and hence thinning of the upper thermocline in the central-to-eastern subtropics. Almost all of this thinning signal, however, recirculates within the subtropics, and does not extend to the equator. Another midlatitude response is shallowing (deepening) of the thermocline in the subtropical (subpolar) ocean in response to Ekman pumping. This, primarily, first-baroclinic-mode (n = 1) response has the most influence on the equatorial thermocline. First-baroclinic-mode Rossby waves propagate to the western boundary of the basin where they reflect as packets of coastal Kelvin and short-wavelength Rossby waves that carry the midlatitude signal to the equator. Subsequently, equatorial Kelvin waves spread it along the equator, leading to a shoaling and thinning of the equatorial thermocline. The layer-thickness field It in the 11/2-layer model corresponds to thermocline depth in the GCM. Both the sponge layer and subpolar Ekman suction are important factors for the 11/2-layer model solutions, requiring water upwelled in the interior ocean to be transported into the sponge layer via the western boundary layer. In the small basin, equatorial h thins in response to weakened westerlies when there is a sponge layer, but it thickens when there is not. In the large basin, equatorial h is unaffected by weakened westerlies when there is a sponge layer, but it thins when water is allowed to entrain into the layer in the subpolar gyre. It is concluded that the thinning of the equatorial thermocline in the GCM solutions is caused by the sponge layer in the small basin and by entrainment in the subpolar ocean in the large one.\\nC1 Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Frontier Res Ctr Global Change, Kanazawa Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan.\\n   Univ Hawaii Manoa, Int Pacific Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.\\n   Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Meteorol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.\\n   Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Oceanog, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.\\nRP Nonaka, M (通讯作者)，Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Frontier Res Ctr Global Change, Kanazawa Ku, 3173-25 Showamachi, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan.\\nEM nona@jamstec.go.jp\\nRI Xie, Shang-Ping/C-1254-2009; Nonaka, Masami/G-3417-2014\\nOI Xie, Shang-Ping/0000-0002-3676-1325; Nonaka, Masami/0000-0003-2522-0686\\nNR 37\\nTC 5\\nZ9 5\\nU1 0\\nU2 5\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA\\nSN 0022-3670\\nEI 1520-0485\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

Results show the locations and orientations of the major oceanic fronts as well as the characteristics of the currents within these fronts in the area. Double subtropical fronts are observed in the section along 120 degrees E, which conflicts with the frontal structure frequently observed before-the North Subtropical Front (NSTF) and South Subtropical Front (SSTF) merge into a single STF between 110 degrees similar to 115 degrees E. The Subantarctic Front (SAF), influenced by the out-of-phase double eddies, runs across 48 degrees S three times between 120 degrees and 127 degrees E. The surface current within the SAF is strengthened up to 105.4 cm/s by the geostrophic effect of these eddies Furthermore eddies may cause the strong current to split up into two branches within the SAF. The SAF and the primary polar front (PF1) can be identified individually in the ADCP data with a separation distance of about 0.3 degrees at latitude between 140 degrees and 145 degrees E, although they cannot be identified separately in the low-resolution hydrographic data. The different thermohaline characteristics of Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) and Modified Circumpolar Deep Water (MCDW) result in the formation of Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front (SACCF) in the southeast Indian Ocean. It consistently turns northward along the east flank of the Kerguelen Plateau after it runs through the Princess Elizabeth Trough and turns southward sharply north of 60 degrees S with a little seasonal variations. It is shown that the locations and orientations of the SAF, the primary PF and SACCF in the ACC of the southeast Indian Ocean can be identified more precisely by the current distribution derived from ADCP data than by hydrographic data, because these fronts are usually accompanied by strong currents. However, the locations and orientations of the STF and the secondary PF are more difficult to be identified through current data, since these two fronts are usually not accompanied by any jet. The STF the and the secondary PF are usually confined in the first few hundred meters of the upper ocean and the latter is often determined by the northern terminus of 2 degrees C isothermal.\\nC1 Polar Res Inst China, Shanghai 200136, Peoples R China.\\n   Xiamen Univ, Dept Oceanog, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China.\\n   Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA.\\nRP Dong, ZQ (通讯作者)，Polar Res Inst China, Shanghai 200136, Peoples R China.\\nEM dongzhaoqian@pric.gov.cn\\nNR 21\\nTC 3\\nZ9 8\\nU1 0\\nU2 2\\nPU SPRINGER\\nPI NEW YORK\\nPA 233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA\\nSN 0253-505X\\nEI 1869-1099\\nJ9 ACTA OCEANOL SIN\\nJI Acta Oceanol.

Global Biogeochemical Cycles 16, 1130-1145] was applied to the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) data from Indian Ocean to obtain additional estimates on the remineralization ratios (P\\\\N\\\\C-org\\\\-O-2) of organic matter in the oxygenated regions. The results show systematic changes of the remineralization ratios with latitude and depth in the Indian Ocean. The average remineralization ratios for Indian warm water masses (potential temperature theta > similar to 10 degrees C are P\\\\N\\\\C-org\\\\-O-2 = 1\\\\(15.6 +/- 0.7)\\\\(110 +/- 9)\\\\(159 +/- 8). These are comparable to the traditional Redfield ratios (P\\\\N\\\\C-org\\\\-O-2 = 1\\\\16\\\\106\\\\138), and are in good agreement with Anderson\\'s [On the hydrogen and oxygen content of marine phytoplankton. Deep-Sea Research 142, 1675-1680.] values of P\\\\N\\\\C-org\\\\-O-2 = 1\\\\16\\\\106\\\\150 within the given uncertainties. Separation of nitrate deficits resulting from aerobic partial nitrification (M) and anaerobic denitrification (dN \\'\\') processes using empirical equations is shown to be useful and consistent with other observations. The dN maximum coincides with the phosphate and nitrate maximums, lies within the oxycline below the oxygen minimum zone, and is in contact with the continental slope sediments. The dN \\'\\' maximum lies within the oxygen minimum zone with O-2 <similar to 2 mu mol/kg, is in contact with shelf or upper slope sediments, and is always associated with a secondary nitrite maximum in the water column. The spatial extent of dN is much larger than that of dN \\'\\'. The low N/P remineralization ratio (< 15) for deep waters (theta <similar to 10 degrees C) and the dN maximum in the lower oxycline can be best explained by the partial conversion of organic nitrogen into N-2, N2O, and NO by yet unidentified bacteria during oxidation of organic matter. These bacteria may have evolved in a low oxygen and high nitrate environment to utilize both oxygen and nitrate as terminal electron acceptors during oxidation of organic matter (i.e. the partial nitrification hypothesis). Direct proof is urgently needed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Samples were collected for isotope analysis of nitrate, particulate material (including size fractionated samples), and particles trapped in the water column from beneath the Fe-enriched patch. In all sample types, delta N-15 changed in response to increased phytoplankton productivity after the Fe enrichment. The nitrate concentration and delta N-15 of nitrate were inversely related, the result of the opposing effects of isotope fractionation during nitrate assimilation and the addition of new nitrate by periodic mixing of water from outside the Fe patch. During the growth period a decrease in the difference of the delta 15N of particulate nitrogen and nitrate occurred that was attributed to physical mixing, shifts in growth from regenerated nitrogen sources to nitrate, and the change in the community assemblage from < 5-mu m phytoplankton cells to a larger assemblage dominated by diatoms. The surface-tethered sediment trap delta N-15 samples indicate that the nitrate isotope fractionation signal in surface waters was not transported below the permanent mixed layer until the end of the phytoplankton growth period, and therefore only the highest values associated with the isotope fractionation process were recorded in the sinking material from the patch. An important conclusion from this study is that mesoscale physical mixing effects and nitrogen remineralization can reduce the expression of isotope fractionation during phytoplankton growth, explaining why the high fractionation values measured in laboratory studies are not commonly observed in the natural environment.

In the KEBR juvenile loggerheads resided in Kuroshio Extension Current (KEC) meanders and the associated anti-cyclonic (warm core) and cyclonic (cold core) eddies during the fall, winter, and spring when the KEC water contains high surface chlorophyll. Turtles often remained at a specific feature for several months. However, in the summer when the KEC waters become vertically stratified and surface chlorophyll levels are low, the turtles moved north up to 600 km from the main axis of KEC to the Transition Zone Chlorophyll Front (TZCF).\\n   In some instances, the loggerheads swam against geostrophic currents, and seasonally all turtles moved north and south across the strong zonal flow. Loggerhead turtles traveling westward in the KEBR had their directed westward movement reduced 50% by the opposing current, while those traveling eastward exhibited an increase in directed zonal movement. It appears, therefore, that these relatively weak-swimming juvenile loggerheads are not passive drifters in a major ocean current but are able to move east, west, north, and south through this very energetic and complex habitat.\\n   These results indicate that oceanic regions, specifically the KEBR, represent an important juvenile forage habitat for this threatened species. Interannual and decadal changes in productivity of the KEBR may be important to the species\\'s population dynamics. Further, conservation efforts should focus on identifying and reducing threats to the survival of loggerhead turtles in the KEBR. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

If a coastal ocean is to be understood and modeled accurately, the external forcing that drives the largest portions of the circulation variability must be observed adequately. Thus, some method of comparing the relative importance of various sources of circulation variability must be developed, so that there is confidence that the most important sources of variability are included in any analysis or modeling. This is done for variability in the time-integrated transport across a section in a coastal ocean.\\n   The relative importance of various sources of circulation variability in the Gulf of Maine (GoM) are then quantified, with an emphasis on variability on timescales longer than tidal or weather-band timescales. In order to concentrate on interannual changes, the seasonal cycle is not included in estimates of variability. It is found that the variability forced by fluctuations in the winds and the volume of water entering from the Scotian Shelf to the GoM produce roughly comparable amounts of circulation variability. However, changes in the density structure of the GoM produce changes in time-integrated transport that are an order of magnitude larger, at least in the central GoM. The changes in the large-scale density gradients are governed by mixing processes in the Gulf and by changes in the water masses entering the GoM from the Scotian Shelf and the Northeast Channel. Unless the heat, freshwater and volume transport of the waters entering the GoM are routinely observed, numerical models will fail to capture much of the variability in the circulation of the Gulf. An analysis is given of the minimal set of observations needed to allow numerical models of the GoM to resolve adequately the true variability in the circulation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The goal of the present study is to identify biologically rich areas within the northern California Current and to determine the environmental characteristics occurring within these areas. We analyzed how surface nekton are distributed in the northern California Current, not only in space and time but also with reference to species assemblages, habitat characteristics, and environmental factors. Sampling was conducted during June and August of 2000 and 2002 as part of the US GLOBEC mesoscale surveys from Newport, Oregon, in the north to Crescent City, California, in the south. A geostatistical approach was used to create surfaces to be used in a GIS to determine the presence or absence of biological hotspots throughout the region. Two biological hotspots were identified and determined to persist in space and time, yet differed with respect to biological and physical features and in the amount of area covered. We used indicator species analyses (ISA) and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) to explore patterns in community structure. Results indicate that although the locations of the biological hotspots persisted over the course of the study, the habitat characteristics and nekton community composition within each hotspot varied over time. The most consistent environmental parameters explaining the distributions were sea-surface temperature, salinity, and density, indicating the likely structuring mechanism of the hotspots is related to the flow through the region and differing patterns of circulation.

The investigation focused on the influence of the earth\\'s rotation on the lateral distribution of the flow, with particular emphasis on the transverse circulation. Along-basin wind stress with no rotation caused a circulation dominated by an axially symmetric transverse structure consisting of downwind flow over the shoals and upwind flow in the channel along the whole domain. Transverse circulation was important only at the head of the system where the water sank and reversed direction to move toward the mouth. The wind-induced flow pattern under the effects of the earth\\'s rotation depended on the ratio of the maximum basin\\'s depth h to the Ekman depth d. The solution tended to that described in a nonrotating system as h/d remained equal to or below 1. For higher values of h/d, the longitudinal flow was axially asymmetric. Maximum downwind flow was located over the right shoal (in the Northern Hemisphere, looking downwind). The transverse component of velocity described three gyres. The main gyre was clockwise (looking downwind) and occupied the entire basin cross section, as expected from the earth\\'s rotation and the presence of channel walls. The other two gyres were small and localized and were linked to the lateral distribution of the along-channel velocity component, which in turn was dictated by bathymetry. These results compared favorably with a limited set of observations and are expected to motivate future measurements.\\nC1 Old Dominion Univ, Dept Ocean Earth & Atmospher Sci, Ctr Coastal Phys Oceanog, Norfolk, VA USA.\\nRP Sanay, R (通讯作者)，Univ S Carolina, Dept Geol Sci, 701 Sumter St,EWS 617, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.\\nEM rsanay@geol.sc.edu\\nNR 14\\nTC 43\\nZ9 44\\nU1 0\\nU2 4\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA\\nSN 0022-3670\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

Malacosteus typifies the morphological adaptation of this group for the taking of relatively large prey. These adaptations include huge fangs, an enormous gape, and the loss of gill rakers. Despite these adaptations, examination of specimens of this species from different ocean basins shows that zooplanktivory is a common feeding mode of the species, an extreme departure from its trophic lineage. Large calanoid copepods made up 69-83% of prey numbers and 9-47% of prey biomass in specimens from the North Atlantic, the Gulf of Mexico, and throughout the Pacific. As M. niger feeding observations have never been reported, the rationale for this enigmatic feeding ecology must be inferred from other aspects of its ecology. As presently known, M. niger is unique among all vertebrates in the possession of both a long-wave bioluminescence system and a bacteriochlorophyll-derived retinal photosensitizer that allows long-wave visual sensitivity. A two-part theory is presented to explain why M. niger radically diverges from its clade and preys on food it does not appear morphologically suited to eat: (1) the combination of long-wave bioluminescence and vision systems suggests that M. niger may search small volumes for food, and thus may sustain itself energetically by snacking on small parcels of food (copepods) in between rare encounters with large prey, and (2) M. niger may gain the raw material for its long-wave visual sensitivity, and thus its feeding mode, from the consumption of copepods.

A suite of experiments is performed with an unstratified model of the Southern Ocean, forced with a stochastic wind stress that contains a large range of frequencies with synoptic time scales. The Southern Ocean adjustment displays a different character for frequencies below and above 0.2 cpd. The low-frequency range is dominated by an \"almost-free-mode\" response in the region where contours of f/H are obstructed by only a few bathymetric features; the truly free mode only plays a minor role. Topographic form stress, rather than friction, is the dominant decay mechanism of the Southern Mode. It leads to a spindown time scale on the order of 3 days. For the high-frequency range, the circumpolar transport is dominated by the resonant excitation of oscillatory modes. The \"active\" response of the ocean leads to strong changes and even discontinuities in the phase relation between transport and wind stress.\\nC1 Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Phys Oceanog Res Div, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.\\nRP Weijer, W (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Phys Oceanog Res Div, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.\\nEM wweijer@ucsd.edu\\nRI Gille, Sarah T./B-3171-2012; Weijer, Wilbert/A-7909-2010; Weijer,\\n   Wilbert/AAT-3247-2021\\nOI Weijer, Wilbert/0000-0002-5654-562X; Gille, Sarah/0000-0001-9144-4368\\nNR 43\\nTC 29\\nZ9 29\\nU1 1\\nU2 5\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA\\nSN 0022-3670\\nEI 1520-0485\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

This study investigates the circulation within Bodega Bay (in the lee of a small headland), in an upwelling region, and the potential for retention of plankton. During the upwelling season of 2004, time series of temperature and velocity were recorded throughout Bodega Bay, conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) surveys were conducted, and surface drifters were released during upwelling, downwelling, and relaxation conditions. Postlarval settlement was monitored daily over two periods coinciding with CTD surveys. Under strong upwelling favorable conditions, wind-driven surface currents were equatorward both offshore and throughout the bay. However, there was significant current shear along the eastern shore of the bay where cold bottom waters move poleward, counter to the direction of the wind-driven surface flow. During downwelling and relaxation conditions, flow was poleward throughout the water column along the eastern shore of the bay. Postlarvae settled during all wind conditions, but greatest settlement was observed at the onset of upwelling favorable conditions. While no \"typical\\'\\' upwelling shadow is evident in the lee of the Bodega headland, subsurface recirculation driven by the alongshore flow past Bodega Head may facilitate the retention of plankton in the bay. Previous studies have generally focused on large headlands; however, it is likely that other small embayments in the lee of small headlands may also provide retention opportunities for planktonic organisms in upwelling regions.\\nC1 Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.\\n   Univ Calif Davis, Bodega Marine Lab, Bodega Bay, CA 94923 USA.\\nRP Roughan, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.\\nEM mroughan@ucsd.edu; ambermace@yahoo.com; jllargier@ucdavis.edu;\\n   sgmorgan@ucdavis.edu; jfish@ucdavis.edu; mlc@coast.ucsd.edu\\nRI Roughan, Moninya/B-5563-2009\\nOI Roughan, Moninya/0000-0003-3825-7533; /0000-0002-3458-4775\\nNR 47\\nTC 89\\nZ9 90\\nU1 1\\nU2 13\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

A limited area domain with a high-resolution curvilinear grid is utilized. The response of the coastal ocean to forcing by observed wind stress and heat flux during the summer 2001 time period of the Coastal Ocean Advances in Shelf Transport ( COAST) field experiment is investigated. Model results are compared to COAST current and hydrographic measurements. The shelf velocity and density fields are generally characterized by the presence of a southward alongshore coastal jet with an upwelling density front on the shoreward side of the jet. The large variability in shelf topography associated with Heceta Bank exerts a major influence on the shelf velocity and density fields. Over the bank the alongshore coastal jet is displaced offshore, and colder upwelled water extends farther from the coast. Northward mean flow and upward motion are found inshore of the jet. Three-dimensional flow structures in response to variable shelf bottom topography are presented, and an analysis of time- and space-dependent alongshore momentum balances is applied to clarify the associated dynamics. In general, northward pressure gradients, set up over the bank during southward upwelling winds, accelerate currents on the inshore side of the jet northward when the winds relax. Analysis of term balances in the depth-averaged equation for potential temperature shows that during upwelling, across-shore advection makes the major contribution to cooling over most of the region, except inshore over Heceta Bank, where alongshore advection also plays a significant role.\\nC1 Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Math & Atmospher, Marine & Coastal Environm Program, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.\\n   Oregon State Univ, Coll Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.\\nRP Gan, JP (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Math & Atmospher, Marine & Coastal Environm Program, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.\\nEM magan@ust.hk; jallen@coas.oregonstate.edu\\nRI Gan, Jianping/AAJ-6821-2021\\nOI Gan, Jianping/0000-0001-9827-7929\\nNR 17\\nTC 31\\nZ9 32\\nU1 0\\nU2 10\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

Individual canopy elements made from gypsum were dissolved in fresh water to simulate the mass transfer of dissolved metabolites to and from canopies of living benthic organisms. Mass transfer rates under oscillatory flow were up to three times higher than values measured for a comparable unidirectional current. This enhancement was shown to be a strong function of the canopy element spacing. A model was developed to predict canopy mass transfer rates on the basis of the in-canopy flow speed and was generalized to incorporate either unidirectional or oscillatory flow. Agreement between the modeled and experimentally measured mass transfer rates indicate that enhanced mass transfer to/from living benthic canopies under oscillatory flow is driven primarily by the higher in-canopy water motion generated by the oscillatory flow, as detailed in the companion paper (Lowe et al., 2005).\\nC1 Stanford Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Environm Fluid Mech Lab, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.\\n   Univ Hawaii, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA.\\nRP Lowe, RJ (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Environm Fluid Mech Lab, Terman Bldg,Room M-29, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.\\nEM rlowe@stanford.edu; koseff@stanford.edu; monismith@stanford.edu;\\n   falter@hawaii.edu\\nRI Lowe, Ryan/A-5032-2012\\nOI Lowe, Ryan/0000-0002-7080-8406; Koseff, Jeffrey/0000-0003-2121-4844;\\n   Monismith, Stephen/0000-0002-7388-3313\\nNR 35\\nTC 212\\nZ9 213\\nU1 2\\nU2 20\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

Dominant variability at long timescales for both model and data in the southern IX1 region was associated with Pacific El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events; at the northern end it was due to remote equatorial Indian Ocean forcing and Indian Ocean Dipole Mode events. In the Indo-Pacific domain the model reproduced the structure and magnitude of observed low-frequency variability. Event analyses following the warm ENSO phase showed low-frequency off-equatorial Rossby waves interacting with the North Pacific western maritime boundary to reflect onto the equator and excite a coastally trapped response that propagated through the Indonesian seas and along the northwest coast of Australia. In turn, the signal progressively propagated away from this coast as free baroclinic Rossby waves to 90 degrees E. Cross-spectral analyses confirmed that on interannual timescales, both off-equatorial and equatorial signals remotely forced in the Pacific were largely responsible for the strong observed and modeled variability at the southern end of IX1.\\nC1 USN, Postgrad Sch, Dept Oceanog, Monterey, CA 93943 USA.\\n   Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.\\nRP McClean, JL (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.\\nEM jmcclean@ucsd.edu\\nNR 43\\nTC 20\\nZ9 22\\nU1 1\\nU2 4\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

In contrast, light conditions were most favorable during SEEDS and SERIES as well as during IronEx-2. The two extreme experiments, EisenEx and SEEDS, can be linked via EisenEx bottle incubations with shallower simulated WML depth. Large diatoms always benefit the most from Fe addition, where a remarkably small group of thriving diatom species is dominated by universal response of Pseudo-nitzschia spp. Significant response of these moderate ( 10 - 30 mu m), medium ( 30 - 60 mu m), and large (> 60 mu m) diatoms is consistent with growth physiology determined for single species in natural seawater. The minimum level of \"dissolved\\'\\' Fe ( filtrate < 0.2 mu m) maintained during an experiment determines the dominant diatom size class. However, this is further complicated by continuous transfer of original truly dissolved reduced Fe(II) into the colloidal pool, which may constitute some 75% of the \"dissolved\\'\\' pool. Depth integration of carbon inventory changes partly compensates the adverse effects of a deep WML due to its greater integration depths, decreasing the differences in responses between the eight experiments. About half of depth-integrated overall primary productivity is reflected in a decrease of DIC. The overall C/Fe efficiency of DIC uptake is DIC/Fe similar to 5600 for all eight experiments. The increase of particulate organic carbon is about a quarter of the primary production, suggesting food web losses for the other three quarters. Replenishment of DIC by air/sea exchange tends to be a minor few percent of primary CO2 fixation but will continue well after observations have stopped. Export of carbon into deeper waters is difficult to assess and is until now firmly proven and quite modest in only two experiments.\\nC1 Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Isle Of Texel, Netherlands.\\n   Univ Groningen, NL-9750 AA Haren, Netherlands.\\n   Univ Otago, Dept Chem, Ctr Chem & Phys Oceanog, Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Dunedin 9003, New Zealand.\\n   Moss Landing Marine Labs, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA.\\n   Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92195 USA.\\n   Univ Tokyo, Ocean Res Inst, Nakano Ku, Tokyo 1648639, Japan.\\n   Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, D-27515 Bremerhaven, Germany.\\n   Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.\\n   Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA.\\n   Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.\\n   Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut Biol & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.\\n   Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\n   Univ Bretagne Occidentale, Brest, France.\\n   IFM GEOMAR, Leibniz Inst Meereswissensch, D-24148 Kiel, Germany.\\n   Rutgers State Univ, Inst Marine & Coastal Sci, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.\\n   Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Atmospher Marine & Coastal Environm Program, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.\\n   Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USA.\\n   Free Univ Brussels, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.\\n   Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Wellington, New Zealand.\\n   Univ Laval, Dept Biol Quebec Ocean, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada.\\n   Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.\\n   Cent Res Inst Elect Power Ind, Chiba 2701194, Japan.\\n   Natl Inst Environm Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan.\\n   Tohoku Natl Fisheries Res Inst, Shiogama, Miyagi 9850001, Japan.\\n   Univ Tokyo, Dept Aquat Biosci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138657, Japan.\\n   Univ Western Australia, Ctr Water Res, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.\\n   Inst Ocean Sci, Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Sidney, BC V8L 4B2, Canada.\\nRP de Baar, HJW (通讯作者)，Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, POB 59, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Isle Of Texel, Netherlands.\\nEM debaar@nioz.nl\\nRI Waite, Anya M/A-5492-2015; Riebesell, Ulf/AAC-9717-2020; Croot,\\n   Peter/U-5296-2019; Nishioka, Jun/F-5314-2011; Rijkenberg,\\n   Micha/C-3245-2012; Bakker, Dorothee C E/E-4951-2015; Nojiri,\\n   Yukihiro/D-1999-2010; SAITO, HIROAKI/J-6948-2017; Boyd, Philip\\n   W/J-7624-2014; Croot, Peter L/C-8460-2009\\nOI Waite, Anya M/0000-0003-2965-0296; Nishioka, Jun/0000-0003-1723-9344;\\n   Bakker, Dorothee C E/0000-0001-9234-5337; Nojiri,\\n   Yukihiro/0000-0001-9885-9195; SAITO, HIROAKI/0000-0002-5502-9076; Boyd,\\n   Philip W/0000-0001-7850-1911; Croot, Peter L/0000-0003-1396-0601;\\n   Marchetti, Adrian/0000-0003-4608-4775; timmermans,\\n   klaas/0000-0002-3214-4354; Law, Cliff/0000-0002-7669-2475; Riebesell,\\n   Ulf/0000-0002-9442-452X\\nNR 131\\nTC 534\\nZ9 538\\nU1 3\\nU2 235\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

Remote forcing is also important and expressed through the open boundary conditions. We use a nonhydrostatic, Dietrich/Center for Air-Sea Technology (DieCAST) ocean model to simulate the regional circulation in the vicinity of Monterey Bay, California. Satellite images often show a cyclonic eddy in the bay and an anticyclonic eddy outside the bay during spring and summer. We compare the simulation results with observed mooring and HF radar-derived velocity data. The coastal geometry plays an important role in the generation and movement of coastal eddies. Quantitative comparisons between hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic models are made to investigate the importance of the nonhydrostatic effects in coastal ocean simulation. The results show that both the Sur Ridge area and the Monterey Submarine Canyon contribute significantly to nonhydrostatic effects and small-scale features. The strong nonhydrostatic and small-scale features result from the California Undercurrent flows across sloping bathymetry and interactions with near-surface California Current in summer. Rapid changes in slope in the presence of strong flows cause vertical acceleration, which violates the hydrostatic approximation. Surface-trapped nonhydrostatic fronts also occur frequently in the shallow ocean during winter. These effects have seasonal variation and cannot be ignored in coastal ocean modeling with complex bathymetry.\\nC1 Stanford Univ, Environm Fluid Mech Lab, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.\\n   AcuSea Inc, Albuquerque, NM 87112 USA.\\nRP Tseng, YH (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Computat Res Div, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.\\nEM yhtseng@lbl.gov\\nOI Tseng, Yu-heng/0000-0002-4816-4974\\nNR 62\\nTC 30\\nZ9 30\\nU1 0\\nU2 5\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

Analytical expressions are derived in certain limits for the transit-time distributions and the propagation times (tracer ages) of tracers with exponentially growing or periodic concentration histories at the boundary current\\'s origin. If mixing between the boundary current and the surrounding ocean is either very slow or very rapid, then all tracer signals propagate at the same rate. In contrast, for intermediate mixing rates tracer ages generally depend on the history of the tracer variations at the origin and range from the advective time along the current to the much larger mean age. Close agreement of the model with chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) and tritium observations in the North Atlantic deep western boundary current (DWBC) is obtained when the model is in the intermediate mixing regime, with current speed around 5 cm s(-1) and mixing time scale around 1 yr. In this regime anomalies in temperature and salinity of decadal or shorter period will propagate downstream at roughly the current speed, which is much faster than the spreading rate inferred from CFC or tritium-helium ages (approximately 5 cm s(-1) as compared with 2 cm s(-1)). This rapid propagation of anomalies is consistent with observations in the subpolar DWBC, but is at odds with inferences from measurements in the tropical DWBC. This suggests that observed tropical temperature and salinity anomalies are not simply propagated signals from the north. The sensitivity of the tracer spreading rates to tracer and mixing time scales in the model suggests that tight constraints on the flow and transport in real DWBCs may be obtained from simultaneous measurements of several different tracers-in particular, hydrographic anomalies and steadily increasing transient tracers.\\nC1 Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.\\n   NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, New York, NY 10025 USA.\\nRP Waugh, DW (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, 3400 N Charles, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.\\nEM waugh@jhu.edu\\nRI Waugh, Darryn W/K-3688-2016\\nOI Waugh, Darryn W/0000-0001-7692-2798; Hall, Timothy/0000-0003-1755-4889\\nNR 39\\nTC 18\\nZ9 18\\nU1 0\\nU2 2\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA\\nSN 0022-3670\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

Therefore, to provide formulas for numerical circulation and ocean climate models, two simple formulas for volume flux are developed here. They are fitted to numerical values of the critical flux for constant potential vorticity flow over a flat bottom through a constriction. The two formulas of increasing complexity agree with the numerical values to better than 6% and 1.4%. These flux values are up to 24% less than the values of flux from zero potential vorticity formulas presently applied to ocean passages. The most precise new formula is used to predict flux magnitude through nine ocean passages that have current meter measurements. The size of the revisions compared to zero potential vorticity predictions is a few percent in the direction of better agreement. For further improvement between prediction and observation, other factors such as realistic bottom topography, friction, mixing, waves, and eddies must be included.\\nC1 Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Phys Oceanog, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\nRP Whitehead, JA (通讯作者)，Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Phys Oceanog, MS 21, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\nEM jwhitehead@whoi.edu\\nNR 17\\nTC 3\\nZ9 3\\nU1 0\\nU2 2\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

Traditionally this reduction in circulation is attributed to ail intergyre eddy vorticity flux that cancels some of the wind input, part of which does not require a Lagrangian mass exchange (theory of dissipative meandering). Herein the intergyre eddy vorticity flux is shown to be a controlling factor in barotropic models at high Reynolds number only with exactly antisymmetric gyres and slip boundary conditions. Almost no intergyre flux Occurs when no-slip boundary conditions are used, yet the subtropical gyre is still significantly weaker in multiple-gyre calculations. Sinuous modes of instability present only in multiple gyres are shown here to vastly increase the eddy vorticity transport efficiency. This increase in efficiency reduces the mean circulation necessary for equilibrium. With slip boundary conditions, the intergyre eddy transport is possibly much larger. However, with wind forcing relevant for the ocean-two unequal gyres-a mean flow flux of vorticity rather than an eddy flux between the regions of opposing wind forcing is increasingly important with increasing Reynolds number. A physical rationalization of the differing results is provided by diagnosis of the equilibrium vorticity budget and eddy transport efficiency. Calculations varying 1) boundary conditions, 2) sources and sinks of vorticity, 3) eddy transport efficiency, and 4) the degree of symmetry of the gyres are discussed.\\nC1 MIT, Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Joint Program Oceanog & Ocean Engn, Woods Hole, MA USA.\\nRP Fox-Kemper, B (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.\\nEM baylor@alum.mit.edu\\nRI Fox-Kemper, Baylor/A-1159-2007\\nOI Fox-Kemper, Baylor/0000-0002-2871-2048\\nNR 63\\nTC 10\\nZ9 10\\nU1 0\\nU2 4\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA\\nSN 0022-3670\\nEI 1520-0485\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

Usually bottle samples yield higher values of POC than pump samples taken concurrently. Several factors, including pressure effects during filtration, particle formation during handling, contamination, and adsorption of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) onto filters, have been suggested as responsible for these differences. As part of a larger study of particles and particle fluxes in the Mediterranean Sea (MedFlux), we systematically and contemporaneously measured various factors that could allow comparison of particle types. The comparison of chlorophyll (Chl-a) and POC immediately suggested a disconnection between concentrations of carbon and Chl-a: bottle and pump estimates of Chl-a concentrations agreed at all depths, while POC and particulate organic nitrogen (PON) measurements did not, especially in the upper 50 m of the water column. These observations suggest that pumps and bottles are equally adept at capturing Chl-a, but that Chl-a:C and Chl-a:N are collected in different proportions by the two methods. Additional experiments using samples collected from the coastal waters of Long Island Sound and in the open Mediterranean, and using algal cultures of both non-fragile Thalassiosira pseudonana 3H and fragile Isocrysis galbana cells, showed no effects of filtration pressure on POC, PN, or Chl-a concentrations over the pressure range of 0.2-0.9 atm. In addition, shaking experiments using bottle samples from the Mediterranean did not show particle formation during handling. Corrections for DOC adsorption on the filters were made and cannot account for the discrepancy between pump and bottle POC. One possible explanation for the pump-bottle POC discrepancy is that bottle samples capture zooplankton that can evade pumps but not bottles. In support of this hypothesis, comparisons of zooplankton caught in Niskin bottles with those retained on > 70 mu m insitu pump filters, showed greater abundances in bottle relative to pump samples. In addition, non-swimming zooplankton (radiolaria) were under-collected by pumps, suggesting that washout of particles off the 70 mu m mesh of insitu pumps during use or recovery may also cause lower POC values. This possibility needs to be further investigated. This study does not address whether zooplankton should or should not be included as POC, but only suggests constraints on the difference between the two methods. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Turbulence in the permanent pycnocline occurs in discrete vertical patches of thickness 20-50 m coincident with layers of elevated vertical current shear magnitude, vertical bar S vertical bar > 10(-2) s(-1). The layers of elevated shear result from high-wavenumber internal waves which may break through shear instabilities as indicated by critical Richardson numbers, Ri < 1. The internal waves are ubiquitous features of strong boundary currents flowing along continental shelves and are likely generated here by geostrophic adjustment of the pycnocline in response to lateral excursions of the boundary current over the Shetland slope or by the scattering of internal tide energy. The pycnocline as a whole exhibits K-z > 10(-4.5) m(2) s(-1), a factor of similar to 3 larger than typical open ocean thermoclines but still implying a weak exchange of water mass properties across the density interface despite the confined and isolated patches of enhanced turbulence which elevate KZ by an order of magnitude. Both the boundary current and the deep interior are typified by weak stratification and locally high K-z approximate to 10(-3) m(2) s(-1), but low turbulent buoyancy fluxes. The strongest observed turbulence and mixing in the channel, epsilon = O(10(-7) W kg(-1)) and K-z > 10(-3) m(2) s(-1) respectively, is observed in the near-bed region over the Shetland slope and results from solibore propagation up the slope and the asymmetric response of the bottom boundary layer to the tidal currents. The overall contribution of the FSC to oceanic mixing would appear, to be about half of the required canonical value of K-z = 10(-4) m(2) s(-1) given the observed short duration and/or infrequent occurrence of the processes generating turbulence in the near-bed region, the spatially confined sporadic mixing patches in the pycnocline, and the low turbulent buoyancy fluxes in the interior and slope current.\\nC1 Netherlands Inst Sea Res, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Netherlands.\\nRP Hosegood, P (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Appl Phys Lab, 1013 NE 40th St, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.\\nEM hosegood@apl.washington.edu\\nOI Hosegood, Philip/0000-0002-4415-7152\\nNR 50\\nTC 17\\nZ9 18\\nU1 0\\nU2 7\\nPU SEARS FOUNDATION MARINE RESEARCH\\nPI NEW HAVEN\\nPA YALE UNIV, KLINE GEOLOGY LAB, 210 WHITNEY AVENUE, NEW HAVEN, CT\\n   06520-8109 USA\\nSN 0022-2402\\nEI 1543-9542\\nJ9 J MAR RES\\nJI J.

During much of this period, the velocity and shear fields in the upper ocean were monitored by Doppler sonar. Near-inertial internal waves are found to be the dominant contributors to the superinertial motion field. Typical rms velocities are 1-2 cm s(-1). In this work, the velocity and shear variances associated with upward- and downward-propagating wave groups are quantified. Patterns are detected in these variances that correlate with underlying seafloor depth. These are explored with the objective of assessing the role that these extremely low-energy near-inertial waves play in the larger-scale evolution of the Canada Basin. The specific focus is the energy flux delivered to the slopes and shelves of the basin, available for driving mixing at the ocean boundaries. The energy and shear variances associated with downward-propagating waves are relatively uniform over the entire SHEBA drift, independent of the season and depth of the underlying topography. Variances associated with upward-propagating waves follow a (depth)(-1/2) dependence. Over the deep slopes, vertical wavenumber spectra of upward-propagating waves are blue-shifted relative to their downward counterparts, perhaps a result of reflection from a sloping seafloor. To aid in interpretation of the observations, a simple, linear model is used to compare the effects of viscous (volume) versus underice (surface) dissipation for near-inertial waves. The latter is found to be the dominant mechanism. A parallel examination of the topography of the western Arctic shows that much of the continental slope is close to critical for near-inertial wave reflection. The picture that emerges is consistent with \"one bounce\" rather than trans-Arctic propagation. The dominant surface-generated waves are substantially absorbed in the underice boundary layer following a single roundtrip to the seafloor. However, surface-generated waves can interact strongly with nearby (<300 kin) slopes, potentially contributing to dissipation rates of order 10(-6)-10(-7) W m(-3) in a zone several hundred meters above the bottom.

A southward shift of the subtropical gyre at increasing depth dominates the structure of the annual mean circulation. Near the southern Indonesian coast the westward South Equatorial Current (SEC) is at the sea surface and strongest near 10 degrees-11 degrees S, reflecting strong influence of the Indonesian Throughflow (ITF). In latitudes 13 degrees-25 degrees S the SEC is a subsurface flow and its velocity core deepens toward the south, falling below 500 m at 25 degrees S. The eastern gyral current (EGC) is a surface flow overlying the SEC, associated with the meridional gradients of near-surface temperature and salinity. The ITF supplies water to the SEC mainly in the upper 400 m, and below that depth the flow is reversed along the coast of Sumatra and Java. Monsoon winds strongly force the annual variation in circulation. Dynamic height at the sea surface has a maximum amplitude at 10 degrees-13 degrees S, and the maximum at deeper levels is located farther south. Annual variation is also strong in the coastal waveguides, but is mainly confined to the near-surface layer. Although the South Java Current at the sea surface is not well resolved in the present dataset, semiannual variation is markedly evident at depth and tends to extend much deeper than the annual variation along the coast of Sumatra and Java.\\nC1 Univ Hawaii, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, IPRC, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.\\n   CSIRO, Div Marine Res, Hobart, Tas, Australia.\\nRP Qu, T (通讯作者)，Univ Hawaii, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, IPRC, 2525 Correa Rd, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.\\nEM tangdong@hawaii.edu\\nNR 42\\nTC 45\\nZ9 45\\nU1 2\\nU2 19\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA\\nSN 0022-3670\\nEI 1520-0485\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

River discharge and sediment concentration data acquired by the US Geological Survey were used to update long-term annual suspended-sediment loads for 17 rivers that range in basin area from 635 to similar to22,000 km(2). Resulting annual load estimates vary over 3 orders of magnitude (0.065-18 x 10(9) kg/yr), with major suspended-sediment fluxes supplied by. in decreasing order, the Eel, Klamath/Trinity, Mad, Rogue, Umpqua and Russian rivers. Down-core profiles of excess Pb-210 and Cs-137 were used to estimate sediment accumulation rates (SARs) at prescribed depths (70 and 110m) and distances (0-40-km north and south along-shelf) from each of the major rivers. SARs were found to vary much less than the river flux estimates, and are mostly in the range of 1.5 to 6mm/yr. Most significantly, shelf SARs on the other Pacific Northwest margins are only slightly less than those observed on the Eel shelf, implying that much higher proportions of riverine sediment are retained on those shelves. Likely reasons that the Eel dispersal system exhibits greater off-shelf transport are (1) the narrower and steeper shelf geometry, and (2) the existence of a newly documented cross-isobath sediment transport mechanism that involves wave-modulated fluid mud flows. Testing whether the fluid mud flows are a consequence of the Eel River basin\\'s high sediment yield, and are thus unique to the Eel. or are caused by intense wave energy during discharge events. and hence are operative on many other margins. awaits future bottom-boundary layer measurements.

Tents were inverted polyvinyl cones, 2-m diameter, 1-m tall, and weighted on their lower skirt edges. Rising gas bubbles induce vertical fluid motions, which were measured by laboratory-calibrated turbines in chimneys on top of the tents. Initial deployment was at an active seep area in the Coal Oil Point seep field, in the Santa Barbara Channel, California. The three tents simultaneously collected data for continuous time periods of 2 hours in both the morning and afternoon. Seabed temperature and pressure were acquired every 3 s over the same time periods as the flux measurements from a conductivity temperature depth, CTD, mounted on one tent. Results strongly suggest that oceanic swell had a significant forcing effect on the flux at a subhourly timescale. There was an inverse relationship between effect of swell height on the flux and flux. Swells from 1 to 4 m height and periodicities of 7 and 12 s caused variations of similar to1% to 4% from the average flux. Proposed mechanisms to explain the observations are diffusion with surrounding sediments, termed gas charging, swell induced changes in fracture size, termed fracture forcing, and swell induced vent activation/deactivation, termed pore activation. On the basis of the seep frequency response, we propose pore activation was dominant.\\nC1 Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.\\n   Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geol Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.\\nRP Leifer, I (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.\\nEM ira.leifer@bubbleology.com\\nOI Leifer, Ira/0000-0002-4674-5775\\nNR 23\\nTC 37\\nZ9 38\\nU1 0\\nU2 7\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

The basic experiment has a resolution of 1/3degrees horizontally and 45 vertical levels, and is subject to a monthly mean atmospheric forcing based on ECMWF flux fields. Sensitivity experiments explore the effects of higher horizontal resolution (1/12degrees), and alternative mixing parameterizations. The model behavior near the equator confirms previous suggestions based on solutions of the WOCE Community Modelling Effort (\"CME\") and the \"DYNAMO\" model intercomparison project, of the presence of a system of vigorous seasonal current oscillations, spanning the whole water column and nearly the whole zonal extent of the basin. The patterns of the primarily zonal current anomalies are fairly robust across the range of model cases investigated, i.e., show relatively little sensitivity to horizontal resolution/mixing, or to the different choices of vertical discretization and vertical mixing as in the DYNAMO cases. The amplitude of the seasonal variation exceeds 10 cm/s in the surface layer, and decreases to about 5 cm/s near 1000 in and 2-3 cm/s in the deep ocean in both the basic 1/3degrees- and the 1/12degrees-cases, thereby leading to seasonally reversing current signatures at all depths below the EUC.\\n   A particular aspect of the seasonal current variability concerns its manifestation in the southward transport of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) by the Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC). The temporal characteristics of the DWBC variability are in agreement with moored current meter observations at 44degreesW, with simulated DWBC transports varying between a maximum of more than 30 Sv in January/February, and almost vanishing transport in September. However, in contrast to the annual-mean deep water transport which is confined to the DWBC and tight, O(100) km-recirculation cells, the seasonal cycle of transport is not trapped near the boundary: the simulations show that the zonal current variations of the equatorial wave guide, near the western boundary give rise to a broad system of seasonal recirculation cells of the DWBC. Calculations of the amplitude of the seasonal variability in the deep water transport near the equator are therefore strongly dependent of the spatial extent of the cross-section considered; in particular, for being approximately representative of low-frequency variations in the net, zonally-integrated meridional transport of deep water in the equatorial regime, transport sections would need to extend over nearly the whole western basin.

Comparisons between surface A. fundyense cell distribution patterns and SST images indicate that highest cell concentrations are associated with colder waters of the eastern segment of the Gulf of Maine coastal current (EMCC) and that frontal zones at the edges of the EMCC often act as boundaries to surface distributions. Surface thermal patterns coincident with a May 2000 PSP toxic event and shellfish harvesting closure on the western Maine coast show enhanced connectivity between the EMCC and the western Gulf of Maine, suggesting transport linking A. fundyense cells in the EMCC to inshore areas of the western Gulf of Maine. Surface drifter data support such transport. Thirteen years (1990-2002) of toxicity data from eight monitoring sites along the coast of Maine and concurrent SST data show that in years of either large or very reduced toxicity, a consistent relationship exists between the timing and strength of fronts, taken as an indicator of alongshore connectivity, and the occurrence and strength of toxic events. Years with weak fronts and/or fronts that become established relatively late in the summer growing season are years of the strongest toxicity events in western Gulf of Maine. Years of early and strong fronts are years with few and/or weak toxicity events. Our results suggest that advective connections exist between cells present in the EMCC and toxicity along the western Gulf of Maine coast and that large-scale hydrographic processes, characterized here as surface thermal patterns, influence A. fundyense populations in the western Gulf of Maine, either through delivery of actual cells or advection of advantageous conditions into the region. These data point to the utility of satellite and other coastal observing system data for the monitoring and prediction of conditions linked to toxic events in coastal waters.

Previous Studies have examined the early phases of the migration with respect to timing. location. and effects of ocean surface Currents On movement. We used satellite telemetry and remotely sensed satellite data to examine relationships between oceanographic features and the movements of adult female fur seals in the Bering, Sea and North Pacific Ocean during early, middle and late portions of their winter migration. Physical locations of 13 female fur seals were monitored during 2002-2003, and diving data were collected on a Subset of the animals. Remotely sensed data were obtained to assess sea-surface temperatures, chlorophyll a concentrations, and sea-surface height anomalies encountered by the fur seals. Data from historical pelagic collection Of fur seals also were summarized to describe winter diet and the distribution of different age and sex classes of the general migration of fur seals to the eastern North Pacific. Seals departed from the Pribilof islands in November and moved in a southeasterly direction over the continental shelf as they left the Bering Sea. Their travel routes did not follow coastal or bathymetric features as they crossed the North Pacific Ocean. but instead corresponded to complementary water movement of the Alaska Gyre and the North Pacific Current. Winter foraging areas varied geographically and were associated with eddies, the subarctic-subtropical transition region, and areas that undergo coastal mixing due to the California Current. The results indicate that fur seals may cue on a variety of oceanographic features that aid in reducing energetic expenditures and optimize foraging opportunities.

Using a large data set of multiple molecular organic markers (alkanes, alkanols, sterols, saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, dicarboxylic acids), we apply (1) principal components analysis (PCA) to obtain a robust comparison of biomarker compositions in Arctic Ocean sediments, (2) geometric mean (GM) linear regression of the PCA variables to estimate the relative contributions of labile/marine and stable/terrigenous sources to each biomarker and (3) the slope of the GM regression of each biomarker with TOC to provide a novel measure of the removal rate of each biomarker relative to phytol. The PCA- and TOC-based indices generally increase together: biomarkers with very high TOC-based removal rates such as the saturated and unsaturated n-alkanoic acids generally have a high labile/marine content from PCA, while the sterols have low removal rates, but exhibit a range of labile/marine content values and the n-alkanes and n-alkanols have low values for both. A dominant feature of all PCA models examined is a progressive decrease in the autochthonous/marine biomarkers with each increase in sediment core depth, which points to a universal diagenetic alteration of organic carbon with depth in the cores. The PCA model also displays a shelf to basin trend that is non-diagenetic and implies the ongoing (centuries or more) delivery of long-chain n-alkanes, n-alcohols and n-alkanoic acids in a matrix that is pre-formed and well-preserved within the sediments. Terrigenous biomarker distributions within the PCA model suggest that atmospheric transport of plant waxes in aerosols and the water borne transport of very fine plant macerals likely have significant roles in the export of these vascular plant biomarkers to the basins. Biomarker ratios and profiles of the PCA-based labile/marine content with core depth indicate that the PCA model is more strongly influenced by the biomarker lability than the marine content, while increases in the marine content are largely responsible for the shifts in composition for near-surface core sections.

The hypothesis is that the density differences imposed at the surface by differential heating are a source of available potential energy that can be partially released by mesocale eddies with horizontal scales on the order of 100 km. Eddy fluxes balance the diapycnal mixing of heat and thus determine the vertical scale of penetration of horizontal thermal gradients (i.e., the depth of the thermocline). This conjecture is in contrast with the current thinking that the deep stratification is determined by a balance between diapycnal mixing and the large-scale thermohaline circulation. Eddy processes are analyzed in the context of a rapidly rotating primitive equation flow driven by specified surface temperature, with isotropic diffusion and viscosity. The barotropic component of the eddies is found to be responsible for most of the heat flux, and so the eddy transport is horizontal rather than isopycnal. This eddy transport takes place in the shallow surface layer where eddies, as well as the mean temperature, undergo diabatic, irreversible mixing. Scaling laws for the depth of the thermocline as a function of the external parameters are proposed. In the classical thermocline theory, the depth of the thermocline depends on the diffusivity, the rotation rate, and the imposed temperature gradient. In this study the authors find an additional dependence on the viscosity and on the domain width.\\nC1 Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.\\n   CNR, ISAC, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.\\nRP Cessi, P (通讯作者)，UCSD-0213, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.\\nEM pcessi@ucsd.edu\\nRI Fantini, Maurizio/H-4871-2011\\nOI Fantini, Maurizio/0000-0003-0962-9190\\nNR 26\\nTC 22\\nZ9 22\\nU1 2\\nU2 6\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA\\nSN 0022-3670\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

In contrast to perturbation sensitivity experiments, the adjoint approach provides a computationally efficient way to characterize both temporal and spatial variations of sequestration efficiency and residence time for a complete global model domain. Sequestration efficiency ( the percentage of carbon injected at a continuous point source that remains in the ocean after an elapsed time), for injections at the base of the main thermocline ( similar to 900 m), is initially lowest in the North Atlantic basin ( except for regions of deep convection in the Labrador Sea) relative to the North Pacific. For injection periods of the order of a century or more, however, the model suggests that Pacific injection sites are generally less efficient for a constant rate injection source. The mean residence time ( defined as the average period that impulsively injected carbon from a particular point source remains within the ocean) is also evaluated and mapped. This measure also suggests that Atlantic sequestration is more efficient in the long term. Our calculations draw out the dual role of convective mixing, both exposing shallow sequestration sources to the atmosphere and also, in the subpolar Atlantic and Labrador Sea, feeding carbon from shallow injection sources into the deep circulation away from the atmosphere.\\nC1 MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.\\nRP Hill, C (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.\\nEM cnh@mit.edu\\nRI Follows, Michael/G-9824-2011\\nNR 39\\nTC 24\\nZ9 25\\nU1 0\\nU2 7\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

We use global one-degree summaries from the World Ocean Database at 11 locations and 10 standard depths in the upper 200 m for the period 1950 - 1993. The seasonality of upper ocean temperature in the CCS is highly nonstationary, with significant interannual to decadal changes in seasonal amplitude and phase apparent over the period of study. The 1950s and early 1990s were characterized by high seasonal variability in upper ocean temperatures, while the intervening years were characterized by a reduced seasonal cycle. Long-term changes in phase were also observed, with seasonal extrema occurring 1 - 2 months earlier in the year by the 1990s. The leading common seasonal components, dominated by the longer ( yearly, 6-month, 4-month) periodicities, explain most of the seasonal fluctuations in the temperature series and partition the variance into well-defined dynamic regions. In particular, long-term changes in seasonality at 30 - 75 m in the major coastal upwelling centers (34 degreesN - 38 degreesN) differed from that observed north of Cape Mendocino, within the Southern California Bight, and farther offshore. The observed spatial patterns suggest that the changes in temperature seasonality off central California reflect a significant low-frequency modulation of the intensity, timing, and duration of coastal upwelling in the CCS. This nonstationarity of the seasonal temperature cycle is superimposed on both a region-wide warming trend and spatially heterogeneous responses to low-frequency climate events, such as regime shifts and El Nino events. Results from this study demonstrate that the character and potential biological impacts of climate variability can only be fully realized by considering a nonstationary, nondeterministic seasonal cycle.\\nC1 NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Pacific Fisheries Environm Lab, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA.\\nRP Mendelssohn, R (通讯作者)，NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Pacific Fisheries Environm Lab, 1352 Lighthouse Ave, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA.\\nEM rmendels@pfeg.noaa.gov\\nRI Bograd, Steven/AAA-4824-2021\\nNR 37\\nTC 14\\nZ9 14\\nU1 0\\nU2 6\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

The instability-favorable portion of these cycles, namely, the August October period of the seasonal cycle and the pre-December period of the ENSO cold phase, both have intense westward flow in the South Equatorial Current, most particularly the branch north of the equator (SECN), and strengthened eastward flows in the North Equatorial Countercurrent (NECC) and the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC). Taken together these flows enhance current shear in the two regions generally associated with TIW activity, namely, the cyclonic and anticyclonic shear regions located to the south and north of the SECN, respectively. Direct correlation of ADCP currents and CTD densities to an instability index derived from equatorial 13-30-day meridional velocities confirms the importance of the strengths of the SECN and NECC in determining the timing of TIW events. Very little correlation was found in the EUC, implying that its strength is not a determining factor in such timing. Reynolds stress and density flux calculations indicate that in a time-averaged sense TIWs derive energy from both the cyclonic and anticyclonic flanks of the SECN, and from both sides of the equatorial cold tongue. During low-instability periods these Reynolds stresses and fluxes substantially vanish, indicating that eddy energy production ceases. This is in marked contrast to Baturin and Niller\\'s study, which indicated that eddy energy production was relatively continuous at 110degreesW. The current structures of individual months associated with TIW activity show substantial variability among themselves. Combined with previous findings of multiple modes of instabilities, this indicates that caution is required when attempting to model instabilities from averages of observed background flows such as those presented here.\\nC1 Earth & Space Res, Seattle, WA 98102 USA.\\n   Dartmouth Coll, Thayer Sch Engn, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.\\nRP Johnson, ES (通讯作者)，Earth & Space Res, 1910 Fairview Ave E,Suite 210, Seattle, WA 98102 USA.\\nEM ejohnson@esr.org\\nNR 45\\nTC 18\\nZ9 20\\nU1 0\\nU2 6\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA\\nSN 0022-3670\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

Sinking of organic matter is shown to be critical to the formation of a deep maximum in biomass in these models. However, the form of the sinking material is not of primary importance to the system: in models with sinking of detritus, sinking of one phytoplankton species, and sinking of all phytoplankton, the effect is qualitatively the same. In the two-compartment nutrient-phytoplankton model, the magnitude of the deep biomass maximum depends more strongly on sinking rate and diffusivity than on growth and death rates, while the depth of the maximum is influenced by all four parameters. A model with two phytoplankton groups which exhibit distinct growth rate characteristics and chlorophyll contents shows how a deep chlorophyll maximum could form in the absence of sinking. In this model, when separate compartments are included for nitrate and ammonia, it is possible to distinguish between new and regenerated production, and the phytoplankton group which makes up the deep chlorophyll maximum is found to carry out almost all of the new production. Variation of eddy diffusivity with depth is also investigated, and is found not to fundamentally alter results from models with constant diffusivity. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Part II:\\n   Along-slope barotropic forcing\\nSO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY\\nLA English\\nDT Article\\nID ROUGH TOPOGRAPHY; OCEAN; WAVES; FLOWS; SHELF\\nAB Recent measurements in a region of continental slope characterized by ridges and valleys running up and down the slope reveal interesting high mode structure in the tidal band velocity signals, with enhanced mixing above the corrugations. In order to understand these observations, numerical simulations of the internal tide generation in this region of topography were performed. Here the focus is on the response of the flow to along-slope barotropic tidal forcing. For small-amplitude barotropic forcing, internal waves are generated over the continental slope that propagate toward the ocean surface and toward shallower water. When higher-amplitude forcing is combined with large-amplitude corrugations, the flow is locally supercritical downstream of ridges, and transient internal hydraulic jumps result. As the flow relaxes each half tidal period, these jumps are released as internal wave packets, which propagate up into the thermocline. The internal hydraulic jumps are a source of mixing in the valleys, while the small-scale shears associated with the internal waves could lead to mixing higher up the water column. Over the forcing range considered, the response is dominated by slightly higher harmonics of the tidal forcing frequency than predicted by existing analytic theories.\\nC1 Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Phys Oceanog, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\nRP Legg, S (通讯作者)，Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Phys Oceanog, MS 21,360 Woods Hole Rd, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\nEM slegg@whoi.edu\\nRI Legg, Sonya/E-5995-2010\\nNR 18\\nTC 41\\nZ9 42\\nU1 0\\nU2 9\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA\\nSN 0022-3670\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

These images were used to develop a water mass analysis and classification scheme that objectively describes the locations of water masses and their boundary locations. This technique combines multivariate cluster analysis with a newly developed genetic expression algorithm to objectively determine the number of water types in the region on the basis of ocean color and sea surface temperature measurements. Then, through boundary analysis of the water types identified, the boundaries of the major water types were mapped and the differences between them were quantified using predictor space distances. Results suggest that this approach can track the development and transport of water masses. Because the analysis combines the information of multiple predictors to describe water masses, it is an effective tool in detecting water masses not readily recognizable with temperature or chlorophyll alone.\\nC1 Rutgers State Univ, Inst Marine & Coastal Sci, Coastal Ocean Observat Lab, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.\\n   Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, San Luis Obispo, CA 93405 USA.\\n   Florida Environm Res Inst, Tampa, FL 33611 USA.\\nRP Oliver, MJ (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Inst Marine & Coastal Sci, Coastal Ocean Observat Lab, 71 Dudley Rd, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.\\nEM oliver@imcs.rutgers.edu\\nRI Irwin, Andrew/B-2245-2008; Schofield, Oscar/H-4169-2018\\nOI Irwin, Andrew/0000-0001-7784-2319; Schofield, Oscar/0000-0003-2359-4131\\nNR 33\\nTC 39\\nZ9 39\\nU1 2\\nU2 13\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

On the basis of remote sensing data, an estimated 8.6x10(12) m(3) of DSW was formed during the winter of 1999-2000, resulting in a mean annual production rate of 0.3 Sv. According to direct observations, the export rate of DSW during this period varied from negligibly small in autumn to 0.75+/-0.27 Sv in winter (January-February), to 0.34+/-0.12 Sv in spring (March-April). From these observations the mean annual export rate can be estimated to be 0.27 Sv. The same relationships used to obtain the integral estimates were also applied differentially using an advective approach incorporating realistic flow and heat flux fields, which allowed direct comparison with the moored observations. The comparison highlights the importance of along-shelf advection and cross-shelf eddy transport to the accurate parameterization of DSW formation.\\nC1 Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.\\nRP Shcherbina, AY (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, 9500 Gilman Dr,Mail Code 0230, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.\\nEM ashcherbina@ucsd.edu\\nRI Rudnick, Daniel L/J-8948-2016\\nOI Rudnick, Daniel L/0000-0002-2624-7074; Shcherbina,\\n   Andrey/0000-0002-4246-487X; Talley, Lynne/0000-0003-1574-729X\\nNR 30\\nTC 19\\nZ9 19\\nU1 0\\nU2 6\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

To estimate these exchanges, geostrophic velocities and heat fluxes were computed from nine sections of closely spaced conductivity-temperature-depth stations across the entrance to the Gulf of California between 1992 and 1999. The mean geostrophic velocity was composed of two alternating cores of inflow and outflow. The two cores that were adjacent to either coast were broader and contained the highest inflow (0.40 m/s) and outflow (-0.25 m/s) velocities, supporting the general idea of inflow along Sinaloa and outflow along Baja California (BC). During winter and spring the baroclinic outflow usually occurred near BC, and the baroclinic inflow occurred either through the center of the section and/or along the Sinaloa coast. Both inflow and outflow cores were similar to45 km wide and extended deeper than 700 dbar. Summer and fall showed a more complex pattern, with alternating cores of inflow and outflow but with inflow along Sinaloa on all cruises. During May the inflow was mainly in the center of the section, while outflow was concentrated along BC. The heat transport associated with the geostrophic flow was calculated and compared with estimates derived from surface heat budgets for the gulf [Castro et al., 1994]. Both the geostrophic flow and heat transport exhibited (for the first empirical orthagonal function mode) a strong seasonal signal with the maximum amplitude in May and the minimum amplitude in late October. A seasonal fit to the net heat transport had an amplitude of 50 x 10(12) Wand phase of 133 days, in good agreement with other authors, further validating the geostrophic velocity estimates. The heat added to (subtracted from) the Pacific Ocean accelerates (decelerates) alongshore currents and appears to propagate similar to10degrees westward as a Rossby wave.\\nC1 Univ Autonoma Baja California, Inst Invest Oceanol, Ensenada 22820, Baja California, Mexico.\\n   Univ Autonoma Baja California, Fac Ciencias Marinas, Ensenada 22820, Baja California, Mexico.\\n   USN, Postgrad Sch, Dept Oceanog, Monterey, CA 93943 USA.\\nRP Mascarenhas, AS (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Baja California, Inst Invest Oceanol, Ensenada 22820, Baja California, Mexico.\\nEM asmj@uabc.mx; rubenc@uabc.mx; collins@oc.nps.navy.mil; rdurazo@uabc.mx\\nRI Castro, Rubén/C-9730-2018\\nOI Castro, Rubén/0000-0002-1587-2704; Collins, Curtis/0000-0001-8035-3102\\nNR 30\\nTC 19\\nZ9 19\\nU1 0\\nU2 5\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

Nitrate concentrations were determined with OsmoAnalyzers deployed at depths of 120 and 180 m. Deployments in 1997 and 1999 captured monthlong events that brought relatively cold high-nitrate seawater up into the euphotic zone. These events were correlated with negative sea surface height (SSH) anomalies measured by the TOPEX/Poseidon satellite altimeter. These nutrient injections at the Hawaii site were predominantly associated with first baroclinic mode Rossby waves. Elevated nitrate concentrations resulted in increased Chl a concentrations, increased primary productivity, and shifts in the phytoplankton community structure, as determined by HPLC analysis of pigment concentrations. The relative increase in pigments associated with phytoplankton that can grow rapidly and exploit nitrate (e.g., haptophytes and pelagophytes) coincided with the passage of Rossby waves in 1997-1999. A long-term combination of satellite remote sensing, moored instrumentation or remote vehicles and periodic ship-based sampling is needed to fully characterize the spatial and temporal variability due to the passage of Rossby waves and their associated biological responses.\\nC1 Monterey Bay Aquarium Res Inst, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA.\\n   Univ Hawaii, Dept Oceanog, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.\\n   Oregon State Univ, Coll Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.\\n   Inst Nacl Pesquisas Espaciais, BR-05508120 Sao Paulo, Brazil.\\nRP Sakamoto, CM (通讯作者)，Monterey Bay Aquarium Res Inst, 7700 Sandholdt Rd, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA.\\nEM saca@mbari.org\\nRI Polito, Paulo Simionatto/L-5399-2019; Karl, David/AFP-3837-2022;\\n   Letelier, Ricardo/A-6953-2009; Polito, Paulo/F-3040-2013; Johnson,\\n   Kenneth S/F-9742-2011\\nOI Polito, Paulo Simionatto/0000-0003-2217-3853; Letelier,\\n   Ricardo/0000-0003-3376-4026; Polito, Paulo/0000-0003-2217-3853; Johnson,\\n   Kenneth S/0000-0001-5513-5584; Ryan, John Phillip/0000-0001-7954-5369;\\n   Karl, David/0000-0002-6660-6721\\nNR 57\\nTC 60\\nZ9 61\\nU1 0\\nU2 16\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

The density difference between riverine and salt water as well as the density anomaly contributed by sediment have important consequences on the delivery, transport and ultimate fate of the sediment issued from the land. Most fresh water outflows produce positively buoyant plumes; however, the aggregation and settling of sediment cause the route of sediment transport to diverge from the route of fresh water flow. Sediment is trapped in frontal zones, both in estuaries and on the inner shelf, often resulting in large increases in the concentration of sediment relative to the riverine source. At high concentrations, the density anomaly due to the sediment itself contributes to the vertical stability of the flow, often increasing the trapping efficiency of the frontal zone. Sediment trapping may also occur within the wave boundary layer on the continental shelf, leading to high concentrations within a layer only on the order of 10 cm thick, but which may represent an important cross-shelf conduit of sediment. The high concentration layers formed both by frontal trapping and by wave boundary layer trapping can attain excess densities large enough to initiate down-slope motion on the continental shelf, resulting in an important cross-shelf transport process. Because of these trapping processes, the formation of high-concentration layers, and the occurrence of hyperpycnal plumes, the transport of sediment in river-influenced environments is often dominated by near-bottom fluxes rather than fluxes in the surface plume.

Increases of the near-bottom suspended-sediment concentrations (SSC) recorded at the canyon head were not directly related to the Eel River discharge, but were clearly linked to the occurrence of storms. BBL measurements revealed that during intensifications of the wave orbital velocity, sediment transport at the head of the canyon occurred as sediment gravity flows directed down-canyon. Observational evidence for near-bed sediment gravity-flow transport included an increase toward the bed of the down-canyon component of wave-averaged velocity and high estimated SSC. At higher sampling frequencies (1 Hz), the current components during these events fluctuated at the same periodicity as the pressure, reflecting a clear influence of the surface-wave activity on the generation and maintenance of the sediment gravity flows. The origin of such flows is not related to the formation of fluid muds on the shelf or to intense wave-current sediment resuspension around the canyon head region. Rather, liquefaction of sediment deposited at the head of the canyon (induced by wave-load excess pore water pressures during storms) combined with elevated slopes around the canyon head appear to be the mechanisms initiating sediment transport. The resulting fluidized-sediment layer can easily be eroded, entrained into the water column, and transported down-canyon as a sediment gravity flow. Results from this study reveal that storm-induced sediment gravity flows occur periodically in the Eel Canyon head, and suggest that this kind of sediment transport process can occur in other submarine canyons more frequently than previously expected.\\nC1 Texas A&M Univ, Dept Oceanog, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.\\n   Univ Washington, Sch Oceanog, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.\\n   Texas A&M Univ, Dept Oceanog, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.\\nRP Puig, P (通讯作者)，CSIC, Inst Ciencies Mar, Passeig Maritim Barceloeta 37-49, Barcelona 08003, Spain.\\nEM ppuig@icm.csic.es; ogston@ocean.washington.edu;\\n   bmullenbach@ocean.tamu.edu; nittroue@ocean.washington.edu;\\n   parsons@ocean.washington.edu; rws@ocean.washington.edu\\nRI Puig, Pere/E-5422-2013\\nOI Puig, Pere/0000-0001-6189-5504\\nNR 57\\nTC 119\\nZ9 122\\nU1 0\\nU2 27\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

Some of the inertial phenomena, including the primary balances of the boundary current and basin interior, the temporal behavior, and the changes in the mean state across parameter space are presented. The analysis of these phenomena focuses on the effects of eddies and the type of eddies present. The low interior viscosity allows for more pronounced eddy effects.

In this new scheme, the linear relation between any two neighboring depths was derived using singular value decomposition technique and then was applied to estimate the temperatures at deeper levels using the temperature analyses at shallower levels. The estimated temperatures were assimilated into an ocean model, and the procedure was run iteratively at each time step from the surface to a depth of 250 m. The oceanic analyses show that the new scheme can more effectively adjust oceanic thermal and dynamical fields and lead to a more realistic subsurface thermal structure when compared with the control run and another scheme that is usually used for SST assimilation. An ensemble of predictions for the Nino-3 region SST anomalies was performed to test the new scheme. It was found that the new scheme can improve fairly well ENSO prediction skills at all lead times, in particular for anomalous warm events, and for lead times of 4 - 7 months.\\nC1 NYU, Courant Inst Math Sci, New York, NY 10012 USA.\\n   Univ Colorado, Program Atmosphere Ocean Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.\\nRP Tang, YM (通讯作者)，NYU, Courant Inst Math Sci, 251 Mercer St, New York, NY 10012 USA.\\nEM ytang@cims.nyu.edu\\nNR 28\\nTC 37\\nZ9 43\\nU1 1\\nU2 3\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA\\nSN 0022-3670\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

This is verified with the aid of daily ice concentration derived from satellite passive microwave data using the \"NASA Team 2\\'\\' (NT2) and the bootstrap (BS) algorithms. Large systematic regional and temporal discrepancies arise, some of which are related to the type of convection parameterization used in the model. An attempt is made to improve the fresh-water flux associated with melting and freezing in Antarctic coastal polynyas by ingesting ( assimilating) satellite ice concentration where it comes to determining the thermodynamics of the open-water fraction of a model grid cell. Since the NT2 coastal open-water fraction ( polynyas) tends to be less extensive than the simulated one in the decisive season and region, assimilating NT2 coastal ice concentration yields overall reduced net freezing rates, smaller formation rates of Antarctic Bottom Water, and a stronger southward flow of North Atlantic Deep Water across 30 degreesS. Enhanced net freezing rates occur regionally when NT2 coastal ice concentration is assimilated, concomitant with a more realistic ice thickness distribution and accumulation of High-Salinity Shelf Water. Assimilating BS rather than NT2 coastal ice concentration, the differences to the non-assimilated simulation are generally smaller and of opposite sign. This suggests that the model reproduces coastal ice concentration in closer agreement with the BS data than with the NT2 data, while more realistic features emerge when NT2 data are assimilated.\\nC1 Texas A&M Univ, Dept Oceanog, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.\\n   NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.\\nRP Stossel, A (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Oceanog, 3146 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.\\nEM astoessel@ocean.tamu.edu; thorsten.markus@nasa.gov\\nRI Markus, Thorsten/D-5365-2012\\nNR 55\\nTC 7\\nZ9 7\\nU1 0\\nU2 2\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

Conventional Eulerian Arctic sea ice models use a plastic yield surface to characterize the constitutive behavior of the pack. An alternative is to adopt a discontinuous Lagrangian approach and explicitly model the formation of leads and pressure ridges. We use a Lagrangian ice model that consists of thousands of discrete polygonal floes 1-4 km in width. At the beginning of a simulation the ice floes are frozen together in a square domain. We apply a linearly varying wind stress that deforms the pack by stretching the viscous-elastic joints between adjacent floes. Fractures propagate along joints forming a crack pattern in the model ice pack. The crack pattern defines a system of large plates 10-100 km in width that are aggregates of many individual floes. The average size of the plates is determined by a competition between the rate of crack creation and the speed of the relaxation wave that travels outward from a newly broken joint and reduces stresses in the surrounding pack. Simulation results are used to characterize the formation of the aggregate structure and to determine how the rate of crack creation and the average area of the aggregate plates depends on tensile strength, the wind stress gradient, and the size of the individual floes. After the formation of the aggregate-scale plate structure, subsequent deformation occurs at the plate boundaries. Since the usual state of the ice pack is a state of failure, an interesting situation is created in which the initial wind-driven deformation creates the material conditions or aggregate structure under which subsequent deformation occurs.\\nC1 USA, Ctr Res Dev & Engn, Cold Reg Res & Engn Lab, Corps Engineers, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.\\n   Univ Puget Sound, Dept Phys, Tacoma, WA 98416 USA.\\nRP Hopkins, MA (通讯作者)，USA, Ctr Res Dev & Engn, Cold Reg Res & Engn Lab, Corps Engineers, 72 Lyme Rd, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.\\nEM mark.a.hopkins@erdc.usace.army.mil\\nNR 16\\nTC 34\\nZ9 42\\nU1 0\\nU2 15\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

The model utilizes the nonlinear shallow water equations to phase resolve the mean and infragravity motions in combination with an advection-diffusion equation for the sediment transport. The sediment transport associated with the short-wave asymmetry is accounted for by means of a time-integrated contribution of the wave nonlinearity using stream function theory. The two-dimensional (2-D) computations consider wave group energy made up of directionally spread, short waves with a zero mean approach angle with respect to the shore normal, incident on an initially alongshore uniform barred beach. Prior to the 2-D computations, the model is calibrated with prototype flume measurements of waves, currents, and bed level changes during erosive and accretive conditions. The most prominent feature of the 2-D model computations is the development of an alongshore quasi-periodic bathymetry of shoals cut by rip channels. Without directional spreading, the smallest alongshore separation of the rip channels is obtained, and the beach response is self-organizing in nature. Introducing a small amount of directional spreading (less than 2degrees) results in a strong increase in the alongshore length scales as the beach response changes from self-organizing to being quasi-forced. A further increase in directional spreading leads again to smaller length scales. The hypothesized correlation between the observed rip spacing and wave group forced edge waves over the initially alongshore uniform bathymetry is not found. However, there is a correlation between the alongshore length scales of the wave group-induced quasi-steady flow circulations and the eventual alongshore spacing of the rip channels. This suggests that the scouring associated with the quasi-steady flow induced by the initial wave groups triggers the development of rip channels via a positive feedback mechanism in which the small scour holes start attracting more and more discharge.\\nC1 Delft Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, NL-2628 CN Delft, Netherlands.\\n   Delft Hydraul, WL, NL-2600 MH Delft, Netherlands.\\n   USN, Postgrad Sch, Dept Oceanog, Monterey, CA 93943 USA.\\n   Delft Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, Delft, Netherlands.\\nRP Reniers, AJHM (通讯作者)，Delft Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, Stevinweg 1, NL-2628 CN Delft, Netherlands.\\nEM a.j.h.m.reniers@citg.tudelft.nl\\nRI roelvink, jan adriaan/C-6940-2009\\nOI roelvink, jan adriaan/0000-0002-5367-0003; reniers,\\n   ad/0000-0001-8732-6748\\nNR 65\\nTC 178\\nZ9 180\\nU1 2\\nU2 49\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

From April through June in the years 2000, 2001, and 2002, spectral and wavelength-integrated albedos were measured along 200-m survey lines. These lines were installed at four sites and included sea ice, lagoon ice, fresh ice, and tundra. Initially, all sites were completely snow-covered, and the albedo was high (0.8 - 0.85) and spatially uniform. The concentration of absorptive contaminants in the snow was enough to produce a slight reduction below the pure snow values. As the melt season progressed, albedos decreased at all sites. The decrease was greatest and most rapid at the tundra site, where the albedo dropped from 0.8 to 0.15 in only 2 weeks. The spectral signature also changed as the wavelength of maximum albedo at the tundra site shifted from 500 nm for snow to 1100 nm for vegetation. As the snow cover melted, there was rapid and extensive ponding, resulting in a decrease of the spatially averaged, wavelength-integrated albedo from 0.6 to 0.2 in only 5 days. Extensive pond drainage and below-freezing temperatures caused the albedo to rebound briefly to 0.55 before resuming a steady decrease. Comparison of these results with data collected in the centralArctic show that albedos of fast ice in the coastal regime evolve significantly faster than pack ice albedos. Interannual seasonal variations showed additional melting phases that might be expected during protracted warming. The albedo evolution in the coastal lagoon was different each of the 3 years because of variations in sediment loading of the ice during freeze-up and in the melt/ freeze pattern the following spring. The record early melt in May 2002 followed by a pronounced freezing event 2 weeks later produced a distinct melt regime that gave rise to reduced melt pond coverage and higher albedo. Such events provide insight into processes associated with the melt ponds that will be important for modeling sea ice in a warming climate.\\nC1 Univ Washington, Dept Atmospher Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.\\n   ERDC, CRREL, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.\\nRP Grenfell, TC (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Dept Atmospher Sci, Box 351640, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.\\nEM tcg@atmos.washington.edu\\nNR 33\\nTC 92\\nZ9 95\\nU1 1\\nU2 27\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

However, remarkably few of these have been explored in detail, and none have been rigorously confirmed. This may be because differences between alternative states are too subtle to document in the context of regular disturbance, because one state is naturally far more likely to occur than any other, or because most environments naturally support only one type of stable community. It is also possible that the temporal and spatial criteria required to document alternate stable states rigorously may be too difficult to meet in most circumstances. Nevertheless, the possibility of alternative stable states has recently received renewed attention in the context of marine conservation biology. People may be widening the range of habitats in which alternate stable states are possible, or they may be shifting communities to new domains of attraction that rarely occur in the absence of massive anthropogenic perturbations. The ability of people now to alter ocean ecosystems on global scales may eliminate \"edge effects\" that might otherwise rescue perturbed communities. Ecosystems with alternate stable states are characterized by positive feedback mechanisms that stabilize transitions; even if return to original conditions is predicted (that is, the alternate states are not stable), the same mechanisms will retard recovery. This may explain in part why return to original conditions following anthropogenic disturbance is slower than expected. Slow recovery times and transitions to new states are both potentially costly to human societies. Thus, from a conservation perspective the indefinite persistence of an alternate state may be less important than the presence of feedback loops that slow recovery. Both possibilities reinforce the arguments for application of the precautionary principle in managing marine ecosystems. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

During the CCAMLR 2000 Survey to estimate the biomass and distribution of Antarctic krill, International Whaling Commission observers carried out a visual line transect survey to estimate the number of baleen whales occurring in the survey area. This paper reviews techniques used to estimate krill consumption by baleen whales and in combination with estimates of whale abundance estimates of krill consumption are generated for the South Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. This survey estimates that the present populations of whales feeding in this region are likely to consume approximately 1.6 million tonnes, but possibly up to as much as 2.7 million tonnes of krill within the summer season. Although this only represents 4-6% of the estimated krill biomass in the region (and probably less than this percentage of the total annual krill production), the depleted numbers of baleen whales resulting from past or current whaling activities should be taken into account when setting quotas for the commercial exploitation of krill if there is to be a recovery to pre-exploitation biomass levels of baleen whales.

The assimilation algorithm is based upon the 4D variational data interpolation scheme controlled by the model\\'s initial and boundary conditions. The data sets analyzed include direct and differential travel times measured at the array of five acoustic transceivers deployed by JAMSTEC in the region of the Kuroshio Extension in 1997, Topex/Poseidon altimetry, CTD soundings, and ADCP velocity profiles. The region monitored is located within the area 27.5degrees-36.5degreesN, 143degrees-155degreesE. The results of assimilation show that mesoscale variability can be effectively reconstructed by five transceivers measuring direct and reciprocal travel times supported by relatively sparse in situ measurements. The misfits between model and data lie within the observational error bars for all the data types used in assimilation. We have compared the results of assimilation with the statistical inversion of travel time data and analyzed energy balances of the optimized model solution. Energy exchange between the depth-averaged and shear components of the observed currents reveals a weak decay of the barotropic mode at the rate of 0.2 +/- 0.7.10(-5) cm(2)/s(3) due to topographic interaction. Mean currents in the region are unstable with an estimate of the available potential energy flux from the mean current to the eddies of 4.7 +/- 2.3.10(-5) cm(2)/s(3). Kinetic energy transition has the same sign and is estimated as 2.8 +/- 2.5 .10(-5) cm(2)/s(3). Potential enstrophy is transferred to the mesoscale at a rate of 5.5 +/- 2.7 . 10(-18)s(-3). These figures provide observational evidence of the properties of free geostrophic turbulence which were predicted by theory and observed in numerical experiments.\\nC1 Univ Hawaii, Int Pacific Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.\\n   Japan Marine Sci & Technol Ctr, Yokosuka, Kanagawa 2370061, Japan.\\n   PP Shirshov Oceanol Inst, Moscow 117851, Russia.\\nRP Lebedev, KV (通讯作者)，Univ Hawaii, Int Pacific Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.\\nEM klebedev@soest.hawaii.edu\\nRI Lebedev, Konstantin V/E-4258-2014; Yaremchuk, Max/AAJ-5777-2021;\\n   Mitsudera, Humio/E-3241-2012\\nOI Lebedev, Konstantin V/0000-0002-3997-203X; Mitsudera,\\n   Humio/0000-0001-9481-6921\\nNR 26\\nTC 19\\nZ9 26\\nU1 0\\nU2 2\\nPU SPRINGER\\nPI DORDRECHT\\nPA VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS\\nSN 0916-8370\\nJ9 J OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

The life-history model consists of 13 morphologically distinct life stages of C. finmarchicus, with stage-specific and temperature-dependent molting rates. The model also includes stage-specific vertical distribution and seasonally varying diapause, egg production, and stage-specific mortality rates. The model domain covers the eastern Canadian shelf from 55degreesW to 72degreesW and from 39degreesN to 52degreesN, including the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Scotian Shelf, and Gulf of Maine. A comparison of a 1-year simulation with observations indicates that the physical-biological model reasonably describes the observed abundance and distribution of C. finmarchicus in this region. To determine the effects of ocean circulation in the C. finmarchicus population dynamics, we divided the GSL-SS region into eight sub-areas and compared the net fluxes of C. finmarchicus across lateral boundaries to the net production in each sub-area. We found that the annual cross-boundary exchange rates constitute from <1% to 39% of the local net production, indicating that the horizontal transport of C. finmarchicus by the ocean currents can play a very important role in the dynamics of local C. finmarchicus populations. The results provide insights into the mechanisms of exchange in the GSL-SS system, as put forward in recent hypotheses.\\nC1 Univ Quebec, ISMER, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada.\\n   Dalhousie Univ, Dept Oceanog, Halifax, NS B3H 4J1, Canada.\\n   Univ New Hampshire, Ocean Proc Anal Lab, Durham, NH 03824 USA.\\n   Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS B3H 4J1, Canada.\\n   Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Ste Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada.\\n   INRS Eau, Ste Foy, PQ G1V 4C7, Canada.\\nRP Zakardjian, BA (通讯作者)，Univ Quebec, ISMER, 310 Allee Ursulines, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada.\\nEM bruno_zakardjian@uqar.uquebec.ca; sheng@phys.ocean.dal.ca;\\n   jrunge@cisunix.unh.edu; iamclare@is.dal.ca; plourdes@dfo-mpo.gc.ca;\\n   keith@phys.ocean.dal.ca; yves_gratton@inrs-ete.uquebec.ca\\nRI Zakardjian, Bruno/AAL-9123-2021\\nOI Zakardjian, Bruno/0000-0002-6667-3086\\nNR 101\\nTC 46\\nZ9 49\\nU1 1\\nU2 18\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

Raw rate estimates based on spectrofluorometric and high-performance liquid chromatography pigment analyses were typically in close agreement, but most showed substantial imbalances in growth and grazing. Flow cytometric (FCM) analyses were used both as an alternate approach for distinguishing populations and as a means for adjusting pigmentbased growth estimates for changes in cellular chlorophyll content and biovolume. Total chlorophyll a (Tchl a) gave mean community growth rates of 0.76 d(-1) at 30 m and 0.27 d(-1) at 60 m. Grazing rates averaged 0.56 and 0.15 d(-1) at the two depths, respectively, and 69% of phytoplankton growth overall. For the prokaryotic picophytoplankter, Prochlorococcus ( PRO), rate estimates from dv-chl a and FCM cell counts generally indicated balanced growth and grazing and therefore close grazing control by microzooplankton. At the equator, rate estimates from dv-chl a averaged 0.6 - 0.7 d(-1) at 30 m and 0.25 - 0.26 at 60 m and were consistent with inferences based on diel pigment variations in the 30 - 70 m depth range. Phytoplankton production estimates from experimentally determined rates and microscopical assessments of autotrophic carbon at 30 m ( mean = 19 mg C m(-3) d(-1)) agreed well with contemporaneous measurements by 14 C uptake. Diatom growth rate estimates (1.0 - 1.6 d(-1)), constrained by contemporaneous measurements of silicate uptake, implied a relatively small biomass (10 - 45 nmol C L-1) with high rates of turnover and recycling.\\nC1 Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Oceanog, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.\\n   UPMC, CNRS,UMR 7621, Observ Oceanol banyuls, Lab Arago, F-66651 Banyuls sur Mer, France.\\n   UPMC, CNRS,UMR 7617, IRD, Lab Oceanog Dynam & Climatol, F-75452 Paris, France.\\n   Inst Rech Dev, Stn Biol Roscoff, F-29682 Roscoff, France.\\nRP Landry, MR (通讯作者)，Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Oceanog, 1000 Pope Rd, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.\\nEM landry@soest.hawaii.edu\\nRI DUPOUY, Cecile/I-3746-2015\\nOI DUPOUY, Cecile/0000-0002-2246-918X\\nNR 65\\nTC 47\\nZ9 47\\nU1 1\\nU2 23\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

The fluxes vary over several orders of magnitude and correlate inversely with the mass ratio of lithogenic matter to biogenic opal of the sediments. The role of the lithogenic, or detrital, sediment fraction was studied in batch reactors, by monitoring the release of silicic acid from mixtures of a well-characterized biosiliceous ooze from the Southern Ocean and model lithogenic materials (kaolinite or basalt). The rate constant of silicic acid production and the saturation silicic acid concentration decreased systematically with increasing detrital to opal mass ratio of the mixtures. Both effects, which are attributed to the release of soluble aluminum from lithogenic mineral phases, were incorporated into an early diagenetic model to calculate diffusive benthic silicic acid fluxes from deep-sea sediments. The apparent silica dissolution rate constant, the saturation ( or asymptotic) pore water silicic acid concentration, and the concentration of biogenic opal were the critical parameters determining the model-derived benthic fluxes. Predicted benthic fluxes of silicic acid were compared to values reported for deep-sea sediments with known detrital to opal ratio and asymptotic pore water concentration. When taking into account the dependence of pore water silicic acid build up on the detrital sediment fraction, good agreement was found between predicted and measured benthic fluxes, over a wide range of oceanic areas and sediment composition, from opal rich to opal poor sediments. The model provides a means to estimate the benthic flux of silicic acid for deep-sea sediments for which the asymptotic silicic acid concentration and the composition of the uppermost sediment are known.\\nC1 Univ Utrecht, Fac Earth Sci, NL-3508 TA Utrecht, Netherlands.\\n   Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Earth & Atmospher Sci, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.\\nRP Dixit, S (通讯作者)，CALTECH, MS 138-78,1200 E Calif Blvd, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.\\nEM sdixit@caltech.edu\\nRI Van Cappellen, Philippe/A-2906-2013\\nOI Van Cappellen, Philippe/0000-0001-5476-0820\\nNR 44\\nTC 19\\nZ9 21\\nU1 0\\nU2 12\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

Each year\\'s image time series shows that blooms were intermittent and differed in onset, duration, and intensity with relatively low values observed in 2000. The relation between atmospheric forcing and interannual variability of the bloom timing and intensity is investigated using a coupled physical-biological model. The simulations focus on the effect of cumulative buoyancy loss on convective depths and its implications on surface nutrient availability, chlorophyll concentrations, and other ecosystem components during the study period. We test the hypothesis that the south Adriatic bloom is essentially controlled by the local winter climatic conditions (i.e., maximum convective depth), as suggested by recent findings, rather than the available nutrient pool at the intermediate depths ( 200 - 800 m), which also varies from year to year. For all three years the simulations produced convective depths that were in good agreement with in situ observations. However, the fluctuations in SeaWiFS phytoplankton biomass could be reproduced only if the particular year\\'s nutrient pool was also taken into account. Thus the most probable explanation for the low SeaWiFS phytoplankton biomass observed in 2000 is the reduced nutrient pool because of the return from the transient phase to the pretransient regime of the Mediterranean Sea. Our results indicate that the south Adriatic bloom is a complex phenomenon and cannot simply be explained by interannual changes in convective depth.\\nC1 CNR, Area Ric Roma Tor Vergata 2, ISt Sci Atmosfera & Clima, Sez Roma, I-00133 Rome, Italy.\\n   Univ Miami, Dept Phys, Miami, FL 33149 USA.\\n   Stn Zool A Dohrn, I-80100 Naples, Italy.\\n   Ente Nuove Tecnol Energia & Ambiente, Ctr Ric Casaccia, I-0060 Rome, Italy.\\n   Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USA.\\nRP Santoleri, R (通讯作者)，CNR, Area Ric Roma Tor Vergata 2, ISt Sci Atmosfera & Clima, Sez Roma, Via Fosso Cavaliere, I-00133 Rome, Italy.\\nEM salvatore.marullo@casaccia.enea.it\\nRI Banzon, Viva/D-5499-2014; SANTOLERI, ROSALIA/B-8711-2015\\nOI SANTOLERI, ROSALIA/0000-0002-2900-5054; Marullo,\\n   Salvatore/0000-0003-4203-0956\\nNR 63\\nTC 26\\nZ9 26\\nU1 0\\nU2 6\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

The numerical experiments show that, in the Black Sea, it is possible to reproduce with high accuracy the principal features of sea dynamics, including the genesis of the near-shore anticyclonic eddies, and to predict the spread of oil pollution in the sea.\\nC1 Russian Acad Sci, PP Shirshov Oceanol Inst, Moscow, Russia.\\n   New Mexico State Univ, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA.\\n   New York State Univ, Ctr Marine Res, New York, NY USA.\\nRP Korotenko, KA (通讯作者)，Russian Acad Sci, PP Shirshov Oceanol Inst, Moscow, Russia.\\nRI Korotenko, Konstantin A/K-3917-2017\\nOI Korotenko, Konstantin A/0000-0003-1581-1300\\nNR 44\\nTC 5\\nZ9 5\\nU1 1\\nU2 3\\nPU MAIK NAUKA/INTERPERIODICA/SPRINGER\\nPI NEW YORK\\nPA 233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013-1578 USA\\nSN 0001-4370\\nEI 1531-8508\\nJ9 OCEANOLOGY+\\nJI Oceanology\\nPD JUL-AUG\\nPY 2003\\nVL 43\\nIS 4\\nBP 474\\nEP 484\\nPG 11\\nWC Oceanography\\nWE Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)\\nSC Oceanography\\nGA 717GQ\\nUT WOS:000185079500003\\nDA 2022-06-16\\nER\\n\\nPT J\\nAU Nof, D\\n   Van Gorder, S\\nAF Nof, D\\n   Van Gorder, S\\nTI Did an open Panama Isthmus correspond to an invasion of Pacific water\\n   into the Atlantic?\\nSO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY\\nLA English\\nDT Article\\nID DEPTH-INTEGRATED FLOW; OCEAN CIRCULATION; WIND-DRIVEN; WORLD OCEAN;\\n   NORTH-ATLANTIC; MODEL; ISLAND\\nAB Recent general circulation simulations suggest that, prior to the closure of the Panama Isthmus ( the narrow strip of land connecting North and South America), low-salinity Pacific Ocean water invaded the Atlantic Ocean via the gap between North and South America. According to this scenario, the invasion decreased the Atlantic Ocean salinity to the point at which North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) formation was impossible and, consequently, there was probably no \"conveyer belt.\" In line with this scenario, it has been suggested that the closure of the isthmus led to an increased salinity in the Atlantic that, in turn, led to the present-day NADW formation and the familiar meridional overturning cell (MOC). Using simple dynamical principles, analytical modeling, process-oriented numerical experiments, and modern-day wind stress, it is shown that, in the absence of NADW formation, one would expect a westward flow from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean through an open Panama Isthmus. This contradicts the suggestion made by the earlier numerical models that imply an eastward flow through the \"Panama Gateway.\" An analogous present-day situation ( for a system without deep-water formation) is that of the Indonesian Throughflow, which brings Pacific water to the Indian Ocean rather than the other way around; that is, it is also a westward flow rather than an eastward flow. \"Island rule\" calculations clearly show that the direction of the flow in both situations is determined by the wind field to the east of the gaps. The authors show that exceptionally strong vertical mixing in the Atlantic (as compared with the Pacific) or another means of warm-water removal from the upper layer in the Atlantic (e.g., NADW or strong cooling) could reverse the direction of the flow through the open isthmus. This is most likely what happened in the earlier numerical simulation, which must have invoked (explicitly or implicitly) large quantities of upper-water removal even without NADW formation. On this basis it is suggested that if low-salinity Pacific water did, in fact, invade the Atlantic Ocean prior to the closure of the Panama Isthmus, then this invasion took place via the Bering Strait rather than through the open Panama Isthmus. It is also suggested that, if there were 20 Sv (Sv = 10(6) m(3) s(-1)) of NADW formation today and the Panama Isthmus were to be suddenly open today, then Pacific water would indeed invade the Atlantic via the Panama Gateway. In turn, this would either collapse the existing NADW formation rate or reduce it to about 10 Sv, which can be maintained even with an open isthmus. In both cases the final outcome is a westward flow in the open isthmus.\\nC1 Florida State Univ, Dept Oceanog, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.\\n   Florida State Univ, Inst Geophys Fluid Dynam, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.\\nRP Nof, D (通讯作者)，Florida State Univ, Dept Oceanog 4320, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.\\nEM nof@ocean.fsu.edu\\nNR 34\\nTC 21\\nZ9 22\\nU1 0\\nU2 11\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA\\nSN 0022-3670\\nEI 1520-0485\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

In the western Laptev Sea, sediments from the Siberian flood basalt province account for <20% of surface sediments, while detritus from the eastern Laptev\\'s Lena and Yana Rivers constitutes as much as 40% of seafloor sediments. Eastern Laptev Sea sediments similarly reflect inputs from multiple sources; here, however, local inputs from the Lena and Yana Rivers are most prevalent. Chukchi Sea sediments are more homogeneous in composition, with sediments originating from the Okhotsk-Chukotsk volcanic belt and Bering Strait inflow comprising over 60% of surface sediments except near Wrangel Island and along sections of the Siberian coast. In the Chukchi portion of our study area, the dominant sediment dispersal pathways are from the Bering Strait region to the north and from Long Strait to the east, into the central Chukchi Sea. There appears to be comparatively minimal sediment transport parallel to the Siberian coast at our sample sites ( > 40 m water depth). In contrast, at our Laptev Sea sites (typically > 20 m water depth) sediments supplied by the Lena and Yana Rivers move primarily eastward/northeastward parallel to the coast, with relatively minimal transport to the west/northwest or north to the central shelf. Good correspondence between sediment accumulation patterns and currents on the Chukchi shelf indicates water circulation is an important sediment transport mechanism in this marginal sea. In the Laptev Sea, a combination of river outflow, cyclonic water circulation and the Siberian Coastal Current controls sediment distribution. We speculate that sediment ice rafting may also affect shelf sedimentation patterns through a combination of factors. Our findings have implications for the fate of particle reactive contaminants released to the Siberian continental margin. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The sea-ice model is a thickness and enthalpy distribution model and is coupled to an ocean model. Ice motion data are assimilated by means of optimal interpolation. Assimilating motion data, particularly from drifting buoys, significantly improves the modeled ice motion, reducing the error to 0.04 m s(-1) from 0.07 m s(-1) and increasing the correlation with observations to 0.90 from 0.66. Without data assimilation, the modeled ice moves too slowly with excessive stoppage. Assimilation leads to more robust ice motion with substantially reduced stoppage, which in turn leads to strengthened ice outflow at Fram Strait and enhanced ice deformation everywhere. Enhanced deformation doubles the production of ridged ice to an Arctic Ocean average of 0.77 m yr(-1), and raises the amount of ridged ice to half the total ice volume per unit area of 2.58 m. Assimilation also significantly alters the spatial distribution of ice mass and brings the modeled ice thickness into better agreement with the thickness observed in four recent submarine cruises, reducing the error to 0.66 m from 0.76 m, and increasing the correlation with observations to 0.65 from 0.45. Buoy data are most effective in reducing model errors because of their small measurement error. SSM/I data, because of their more complete spatial coverage, are helpful in regions with few buoys, particularly in coastal areas. Assimilating both SSM/I and buoy data combines their individual advantages and brings about the best overall model performance in simulating both ice motion and ice thickness.\\nC1 Univ Washington, Coll Ocean & Fishery Sci, Appl Phys Lab, Polar Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.\\n   CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA.\\nRP Zhang, JL (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Coll Ocean & Fishery Sci, Appl Phys Lab, Polar Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.\\nEM zhang@apl.washington.edu; rothrock@apl.washington.edu;\\n   lindsay@apl.washington.edu; yanling@apl.washington.edu;\\n   ron.kwok@jpl.nasa.gov\\nRI Kwok, Ron/A-9762-2008; Lindsay, Ron W/S-9083-2016; Kwok,\\n   Ronald/L-3968-2019; Lindsay, Ronald W/C-1083-2019\\nOI Kwok, Ron/0000-0003-4051-5896; Kwok, Ronald/0000-0003-4051-5896; \\nNR 42\\nTC 40\\nZ9 42\\nU1 0\\nU2 7\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

Using tower data, we show that nonparametric models using wind speed and significant wave height provide some improvement over parametric models. In support of Part I of this paper [Millet et al., 2003], inclusion of the RMS long wave slope improves nonparametric EM bias estimation error values by over 50%.

The array consists of both a linear section for standard beamforming and a cardioid section giving it port/starboard discrimination capabilities. The linear section is comprised of 4 modules with half-wavelength hydrophone spacing corresponding to cutoff frequencies of 250, 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz. Each linear aperture is made up of 64 hydrophone channels with a total linear aperture length of 189 meters. The cardioid module consists of 78 hydrophone triplets arranged in an equilateral triangle with 38.5 mm spacing between the individual phones. The linear spacing between each triplet set is 0.2 meters for a cutoff frequency of 3750 Hz. In addition to the acoustic sensors, the array contains 3 non-acoustic sensor suites and and additional pressure sensor to provide real-time array heading, pitch, roll, and depth along with temperature at various positions along the array. Array control for setting of sampling rates, array gain, and monitoring of both acoustic and non-acoustic data is provided by a standard PC. The array supports sampling rates from 6.25-25 kHz for the acoustic data with 24 bit A/D conversion. Array telemetry is ATM/SONET with a data rate of 155 Mb/s. The acquisition system acquires directly to SCSI ultra 320 disk and is based on a COTS Linux workstation. Since taking delivery in May 2002, the FORA has been deployed during three separate sea trials, including the recent Geoclutter experiment held April-May 2003 on the NJ shelf in the Atlantic Ocean. Some preliminary results and data are presented from the different trials illustrating array capabilities along with an assessment of the array data quality for meeting current and future scientific objectives.\\nC1 Penn State Univ, Appl Res Lab, State Coll, PA 16801 USA.\\nRP Becker, KM (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Appl Res Lab, POB 30, State Coll, PA 16801 USA.\\nNR 3\\nTC 37\\nZ9 38\\nU1 0\\nU2 5\\nPU MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOC\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 1828 L ST NW,SUITE 906, WASHINGTON, DC 20035 USA\\nBN 0-933957-30-0\\nPY 2003\\nBP 2607\\nEP 2610\\nDI 10.1109/OCEANS.2003.178321\\nPG 4\\nWC Oceanography\\nWE Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)\\nSC Oceanography\\nGA BAB11\\nUT WOS:000221420300587\\nDA 2022-06-16\\nER\\n\\nPT C\\nAU Bisnath, S\\n   Wells, D\\n   Howden, S\\n   Stone, G\\nAF Bisnath, S\\n   Wells, D\\n   Howden, S\\n   Stone, G\\nGP IEEE\\n   IEEE\\nTI The use of a GIPS-equipped buoy for water level determination\\nSO OCEANS 2003 MTS/IEEE: CELEBRATING THE PAST...TEAMING TOWARD THE FUTURE\\nLA English\\nDT Proceedings Paper\\nCT MTS/IEEE Conference on Celebrating the Past - Teaming Toward the Future\\nCY SEP 22-26, 2003\\nCL San Diego, CA\\nSP Marine Technol Soc, IEEE, OES, Scripps Inst Oceanog\\nAB In recent years, Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers have been placed on buoys to determine sea surface height. The Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVOCEANO) has become interested in this application for tides work and has sponsored a series of GPS buoy experiments in Mississippi coastal waters. The primary goal of the experiments was the determination of water level with GPS using the WGS84 reference ellipsoid as a tidal benchmark. Also of importance was the determination of the minimum buoy sensor configuration (aside from GPS) required to accomplish this measurement, and to evaluate RTK GPS performance over time and distance.\\n   The fully integrated buoy was deployed in 2001, 2002, and 2003. The 2001 RTK results were analyzed for solution availability, solution quality, and solution correlation with other sensor output. Solution availability was high during buoy operational periods; however, the solution quality was hampered by an apparent GPS filter-based anomaly in the receiver RTK processing. Tide gauge comparison indicated sub-decimeter-level water level recovery was attainable. Initial processing of 2002 data produced cm-level differences between RTK and tide gauge water levels. These initial results show great promise for the use of RTK buoys in water level recovery, and more data collection and analysis will be undertaken with the 2003 deployment.\\nC1 Univ So Mississippi, Dept Marine Sci, Hydrog Sci Res Ctr, Stennis Space Ctr, MS 39529 USA.\\nRP Bisnath, S (通讯作者)，Univ So Mississippi, Dept Marine Sci, Hydrog Sci Res Ctr, 1020 Balch Blvd, Stennis Space Ctr, MS 39529 USA.\\nOI Howden, Stephan/0000-0002-7690-6365\\nNR 8\\nTC 2\\nZ9 2\\nU1 0\\nU2 0\\nPU MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOC\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 1828 L ST NW,SUITE 906, WASHINGTON, DC 20035 USA\\nBN 0-933957-30-0\\nPY 2003\\nBP 1241\\nEP 1246\\nDI 10.1109/OCEANS.2003.178031\\nPG 6\\nWC Oceanography\\nWE Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)\\nSC Oceanography\\nGA BAB11\\nUT WOS:000221420300288\\nDA 2022-06-16\\nER\\n\\nPT C\\nAU Bliven, LF\\nAF Bliven, LF\\nGP IEEE\\n   IEEE\\nTI Ring-wave measurements from natural rain\\nSO OCEANS 2003 MTS/IEEE: CELEBRATING THE PAST...TEAMING TOWARD THE FUTURE\\nLA English\\nDT Proceedings Paper\\nCT MTS/IEEE Conference on Celebrating the Past - Teaming Toward the Future\\nCY SEP 22-26, 2003\\nCL San Diego, CA\\nSP Marine Technol Soc, IEEE, OES, Scripps Inst Oceanog\\nID ARTIFICIAL RAIN; WATER SURFACES; SCATTERING; WIND\\nAB We present preliminary results of our efforts to measure ring-waves generated by natural rain.

Camera sled surveys and bottom trawls were used to identify and collect specimens, and camera sled photographs also were used to determine abundances and spatial distributions for each species. The ophiuroid Ophionotus victoriae, the regular echinoid Sterechinus neumayeri, and one or more species of Porifera were the most abundant taxa during this sampling period. Abundances of O. victoriae varied throughout the annual cycle, peaking in June 2000, and were correlated positively with sedimentation rates. In contrast, abundances of S. neumayeri were consistent throughout the sampling period, except for a peak in June 2000, during austral winter. Peak abundances for both species coincided with a large number of small individuals, indicating apparent recruitment events for O. victoriae and S. neumayeri during this time period. Poriferans, as a group, had statistically similar abundances during each sampling period. Low-abundance species tended to be aggregated on both small and large spatial scales, their distributions probably influenced by reproductive method, gregarious settlement, and food availability. The spatial distribution of S. neumayeri in June 2000 and O. victoriae was random across multiple spatial scales, perhaps in response to food availability and broad environmental tolerances, respectively.

Also included are wind stress and high-resolution directional wave measurements from three air-sea interaction spar buoys off the coast of North Carolina from the two month SHOWEX experiment in the Fall 1999. Analyses of the colocated QSCAT and ocean buoys data set will explore differences of wind stress, wind speed and direction. In particular we explore the variability of scatterometer sigma-o observations and subsequent wind measurements with respect to variability in the directional wave properties. We will also examine the dependency of residuals on other oceanographic and meteorologicat parameters such as sea surface temperature, air-sea temperature difference and directional wave properties as well as the location of the sigma-o cell and its incidence angle. Furthermore, we also study the ambiguity removal skill and the quality of winds when several backscatter measurements are used.\\nC1 Univ Miami, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA.\\nRP Graber, HC (通讯作者)，Univ Miami, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA.\\nNR 0\\nTC 0\\nZ9 0\\nU1 0\\nU2 1\\nPU MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOC\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 1828 L ST NW,SUITE 906, WASHINGTON, DC 20035 USA\\nBN 0-933957-30-0\\nPY 2003\\nBP 1044\\nEP 1044\\nPG 1\\nWC Oceanography\\nWE Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)\\nSC Oceanography\\nGA BAB11\\nUT WOS:000221420300245\\nDA 2022-06-16\\nER\\n\\nPT J\\nAU Hyrenbach, KD\\n   Veit, RR\\nAF Hyrenbach, KD\\n   Veit, RR\\nTI Ocean warming and seabird communities of the southern California Current\\n   System (1987-98): response at multiple temporal scales\\nSO DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY\\nLA English\\nDT Review\\nID LONG-TERM TRENDS; EL-NINO; PACIFIC-OCEAN; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ECOLOGICAL\\n   STRUCTURE; TRIANGLE ISLAND; CASSINS AUKLET; LA-NINA; STATE; OSCILLATION\\nAB Declines in ocean productivity and shifts in species assemblages along the West Coast of North America during the second half of the XXth century have been attributed to the concurrent warming of the California Current. This paper addresses changes in the avifauna off southern California between May 1987 and September 1998, in response to shifting water mass distributions over short (< 1 year) and long (interannual) temporal scales. More specifically, our research focuses on the relative importance of distinct foraging guilds and species assemblages with an affinity for warm and cold water. Over the long term, the avifauna off southern California shifted from a \\'high-productivity\\' community typical of eastern boundary upwelling systems, to a \\'low-productivity\\' assemblage similar to those inhabiting the subtropical gyres. Overall seabird abundance decreased; the relative importance of cold-water seabirds that dive in pursuit of prey declined; and warm-water species that feed at the surface and plunge to capture prey became more numerous. These community-level changes are consistent with the northward shifts in species ranges and the declining ocean productivity anticipated as a result of global warming. However, the response of individual taxa with an affinity for warm-water and cold-water conditions has been more difficult to predict, due to differences in species-specific responses to ocean warming. The three cold-water species investigated (Sooty Shearwater Puffinus griseus, Cassin\\'s Auklet Ptychoramphus aleuticus, and Rhinoceros Anklet Cerorhinca monocerata) decreased in abundance during this study. On the other hand, only one of the six warm-water species considered (Pink-footed Shearwater, Puffinus creatopus) increased significantly over the long term. Yet, the warm-water Leach\\'s Storm-petrel (Oceanodroma leucorhoa) increased between 1987 and 1993, and then declined between 1994 and 1998. Moreover, cross-correlations between seasonally adjusted anomalies of bird abundance and ocean temperature revealed that seabirds responded differently to ocean warming over intermediate (1-8 years), and long (8-12 years) time scales. We hypothesize that this nonlinear behavior of seabird populations in response to ocean warming is caused by the juxtaposition of distinct behavioral and demographic responses operating at different temporal scales.

This system is composed of an industrial Pentium III CPU, a GPS time/frequency processor, a gigabit Ethernet interface, a high-speed parallel interface and a custom telemetry interface in a Compact-PCI chassis. A reconfigured version of this system could potentially fit into an eight inch diameter pressure case for autonomous deployment at sea. Control and programmability are provided by LabVIEW running under Windows NT or XP. The combination of the custom telemetry interface and high speed parallel interface provides a flexible, bi-directional channel for multiplexed serial data through coax or fiber at telemetry rates up to 200 MBaud. The custom telemetry interface can be reconfigured for a variety of existing and future telemetry systems utilizing coax and single or multimode fiber. The design of this interface exploits recent transceiver technology that exists for high bandwidth communication applications such as Fibre-Channel and ATM. This commercial technology provides the serializing/deserializing, coding/decoding, bit synchronization and byte framing required for the high-speed fiber link and can be operated synchronously or asynchronously using on-chip FIFOs. Data is recorded by the acquisition system in a standard format that does not require the translation usually required with proprietary data recording systems. Tests have shown that continuous data recording rates as high as 20 Mbytes/sec would be possible using high performance disk arrays. During a recent acoustic experiment off the coast of San Diego, data was recorded from a 128 element transducer array at a rate of 6.5 MBytes/sec. The data was simultaneously moved via FTP over gigabit Ethernet to a UNIX workstation for archiving to DLT tape, allowing the acquisition system to record continuously for several days. The configuration of this system and performance during the recent experiment will be described, as well as other current and potential future applications.\\nC1 Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Marine Phys Lab, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.\\nRP Skinner, JD (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Marine Phys Lab, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.\\nNR 4\\nTC 1\\nZ9 1\\nU1 0\\nU2 0\\nPU MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOC\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 1828 L ST NW,SUITE 906, WASHINGTON, DC 20035 USA\\nBN 0-933957-30-0\\nPY 2003\\nBP 2601\\nEP 2606\\nDI 10.1109/OCEANS.2003.178320\\nPG 6\\nWC Oceanography\\nWE Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)\\nSC Oceanography\\nGA BAB11\\nUT WOS:000221420300586\\nDA 2022-06-16\\nER\\n\\nPT J\\nAU Wong, GTF\\n   Zhang, LS\\nAF Wong, GTF\\n   Zhang, LS\\nTI Geochemical dynamics of iodine in marginal seas: the southern East China\\n   Sea\\nSO DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY\\nLA English\\nDT Article\\nID DISSOLVED ORGANIC IODINE; SQUARE-WAVE VOLTAMMETRY; CHEMICAL HYDROGRAPHY;\\n   CONTINENTAL-SHELF; NATURAL-WATERS; MARINE WATERS; PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY;\\n   EXCHANGE PROCESSES; CHESAPEAKE BAY; CHLOROPHYLL-A\\nAB The distributions of iodate and iodide were determined in a transect across the southern East China Sea Shelf, the upwelling center at the outer shelf-upper slope, the adjoining Kuroshio to the Okinawa Trough. In the surface waters, the variations in the concentrations of iodate and iodide among the surface waters masses, namely, the Coastal Water, the Taiwan Current Warm Water and the Kuroshio Surface Water, were relatively small. The composition of the upwelling Kuroshio Subsurface Water was distinctly different and it could be readily distinguished from the surface water masses by its elevated concentration of iodate, depressed concentration of iodide, and the resulting elevated concentration ratio of iodate to iodide. In contrast, since the variations in salinity and temperature in the surface water masses and the upwelling water were less systematic, neither salinity nor temperature could be used effectively for distinguishing these two types of water from each other. Thus, the iodine system was a complementary, or even a superior, tracer for the upwelling water. In the subsurface, the upwelling water was depicted as a dome of cold, nitrate-rich, iodate-rich and iodide-poor water, with molar ratios of iodate to iodide exceeding 10 that extended from the outer shelf-upper slope to the middle shelf. The influence of the Coastal Water was manifested as a tongue of fresher, iodide-rich and iodate-poor surface water, with molar ratios of iodate to iodide of < 2.5 that extended from the inner shelf into the middle shelf. The oligotrophic Kuroshio Surface Water was also iodide-rich and iodate-poor. A box model calculation revealed that iodate was imported into the East China Sea Shelf system by frontal exchanges with the adjoining Kuroshio and upwelling at the shelf edge. Within the Shelf system, iodate was consumed and iodide was produced. As a result, during frontal exchanges between the Shelf system and the Kuroshio, there was also a net export of iodide from the Shelf system to the Kuroshio. These behaviors of the iodine system in the East China Sea Shelf system are similar to those found in the South Atlantic Bight and suggest that the marginal seas may be a preferred site for the reduction of iodate to iodide so that exchanges between the marginal seas and the open oceans may constitute a significant net source of iodide to the ocean interior.

The resulted ambiguity output is often characterized by a multimodal structure. At high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the peak at the true source position is a global maximum and can be located accurately; below some threshold SNR, the true peak is easily obscured by other ambiguous peaks, leading to a significantly increased localization error. To analyze this threshold performance behavior, a quantitative approach for error analysis has previously been developed in the context of the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) with spatially-white noise [1, 4]. In this paper, the same approach is generalized to work for spatially-correlated noise field introduced by discrete interferences and/or surface distribution sources.\\nC1 RD Instruments, San Diego, CA 92131 USA.\\nRP Xu, W (通讯作者)，RD Instruments, 9855 Businesspk Ave, San Diego, CA 92131 USA.\\nEM wxu@rdinstuments.com; christ@ll.mit.edu\\nRI Xu, Wen/AAD-5819-2020\\nNR 10\\nTC 5\\nZ9 5\\nU1 0\\nU2 0\\nPU MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOC\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 1828 L ST NW,SUITE 906, WASHINGTON, DC 20035 USA\\nBN 0-933957-30-0\\nPY 2003\\nBP 922\\nEP 927\\nPG 6\\nWC Oceanography\\nWE Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)\\nSC Oceanography\\nGA BAB11\\nUT WOS:000221420300211\\nDA 2022-06-16\\nER\\n\\nPT C\\nAU Zavala-Hidalgo, J\\n   Bourassa, MA\\n   Morey, SL\\n   O\\'Brien, JJ\\n   Yu, P\\nAF Zavala-Hidalgo, J\\n   Bourassa, MA\\n   Morey, SL\\n   O\\'Brien, JJ\\n   Yu, P\\nGP IEEE\\n   IEEE\\nTI A new temporal interpolation method for high-frequency vector wind\\n   fields\\nSO OCEANS 2003 MTS/IEEE: CELEBRATING THE PAST...TEAMING TOWARD THE FUTURE\\nLA English\\nDT Proceedings Paper\\nCT MTS/IEEE Conference on Celebrating the Past - Teaming Toward the Future\\nCY SEP 22-26, 2003\\nCL San Diego, CA\\nSP Marine Technol Soc, IEEE, OES, Scripps Inst Oceanog\\nAB A new technique for the time interpolation of the forcing fields that recovers the movement of propagating features is introduced and applied to vector wind fields.

The technique is also applied to a gridded vector wind product from satellite scatterometer data.\\nC1 Florida State Univ, COAPS, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.\\nRP Zavala-Hidalgo, J (通讯作者)，Florida State Univ, COAPS, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.\\nRI Zavala-Hidalgo, Jorge/H-3185-2011; Bourassa, Mark/Z-2428-2019\\nOI Morey, Steven/0000-0002-6585-1688\\nNR 6\\nTC 2\\nZ9 2\\nU1 0\\nU2 3\\nPU MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOC\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 1828 L ST NW,SUITE 906, WASHINGTON, DC 20035 USA\\nBN 0-933957-30-0\\nPY 2003\\nBP 1050\\nEP 1053\\nDI 10.1109/OCEANS.2003.178485\\nPG 4\\nWC Oceanography\\nWE Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)\\nSC Oceanography\\nGA BAB11\\nUT WOS:000221420300248\\nDA 2022-06-16\\nER\\n\\nPT J\\nAU Hernes, PJ\\n   Benner, R\\nAF Hernes, PJ\\n   Benner, R\\nTI Transport and diagenesis of dissolved and particulate terrigenous\\n   organic matter in the North Pacific Ocean\\nSO DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS\\nLA English\\nDT Article\\nDE terrigenous organic matter; lignin; dissolved organic matter;\\n   particulate organic matter; aerosol; diagenesis; photochemistry; North\\n   Pacific Ocean; Station Aloha\\nID STABLE CARBON; AMAZON-RIVER; MISSISSIPPI RIVER; HUMIC SUBSTANCES;\\n   NATURAL-WATERS; PLANT-TISSUES; BLACK CARBON; LIGNIN; DECOMPOSITION;\\n   RADIOCARBON\\nAB Lignin measurements were made on suspended particulate organic matter (POM), total dissolved organic matter (DOM), high-molecular-weight (HMW) DOM, and low-molecular-weight (LMW) DOM in the North Pacific at Station Aloha. Carbon-normalized yields of lignin and delta(13)C measurements indicate that while terrigenous organic matter accounts only for similar to1% of DOM in seawater, submicron POM has a substantial terrigenous component. The apparent size distribution and terrigenous nature of the particles is consistent with an aerosol source, but these particles could also be delivered to the ocean via rivers. Ratios of syringyl to vanillyl phenols as well as the fraction of dissolved lignin in HMW DOM provide molecular evidence of photochemical oxidation. Several differences in lignin composition and concentrations were evident between water masses. In particular, concentrations in North Pacific Intermediate Water were a factor of two greater than at all other depths. This is likely a reflection of higher riverine input via the Sea of Okhotsk. These trends suggest that lignin could serve as a general circulation tracer in addition to tracing riverine input and diagenetic processing of terrigenous organic matter in the ocean.

However, since most of the sea surface is not saturated with water vapor, several studies have been conducted for the empirical Bowen ratio (Bo(E) = Bo*(SST)), which was formulated with many sources of data from many areas. Hicks and Hess\\' [1977] linear regression formula for the BoE as a function of SST alone was used to estimate the empirical Bowen ratio in the tropical Pacific. Climatological and long-term time series Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (OISST) data was used for the climatological study of the BoE. The climatological mean Bowen ratio showed the regions, where the latent heat flux was most dominant. The Bowen ratio in the western Pacific warm pool (WPWP) area (O (0.04)) was 10% smaller than those in the upwelling coastal areas (O (0.14)). Along 5degreesN and 5degreesS, a 0.7 correlation coefficient between the Bo(E) and the bulk formulated Bowen ratio (Bo(B)), using climatological data, was found in the weak wind zone of the doldrums. Bo(B) is the ratio of the bulk formulated sensible heat flux to the bulk formulated latent heat flux. EOF analysis was used to find out dominant temporal and spatial signals of the Bo(E). The first temporal EOF of the Bo(E), using 156 months (1986-1999) of OISST anomaly was related to El Nino events with an approximate 12-month lag when compared to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) index (SOI). The second and third temporal EOF showed annual and interannual signals, respectively. In order to estimate the discrepancy between the Bo(E) and the Bo(B) and to correct for the wind effect and the humidity effect, long-term time series of Tropical Atmosphere Ocean (TAO) data was used. Our results showed that the eastern Pacific demonstrated a stronger correlation between the Bo(B) and the Bo(E) than the western Pacific. However, the Bowen ratio differences (Bo(D) =| Bo(E) - Bo(B)|) were small in the western Pacific, and a larger margin of error was found at the eastern Pacific, where ocean dynamics perturb the upper ocean heat balance. The sensitivity of the humidity and the winds on the Bo(E) was tested using linear correlation of the Bo(D) while varying the winds and humidity. The Bo(D) was small, especially in the southwest Pacific, where there are weak winds and high levels of the humidity. Thus the BoE in our study will be more useful to study involving heat fluxes in the WPWP area rather than those in the eastern Pacific. The correction of the humidity and the wind was applied using a linear regression of the humidity and the winds. After the corrections, the Bo(D) was reduced by an average of 70.2%. Using TAO data, we obtained Bo(E) = 0. 033Bo* in the western Pacific with Bo* \\'s standard deviation of 0. 008 at sea surface temperature 29.27 degreesC +/- 0.54 degreesC.\\nC1 Univ Delaware, Grad Coll Marine Studies, Ctr Remote Sensing, Newark, DE 19716 USA.\\n   Ocean Univ Qingdao, Ocean Remote Sensing Inst, Qingdao 266003, Peoples R China.\\n   CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA.\\nRP Jo, YH (通讯作者)，Univ Delaware, Grad Coll Marine Studies, Ctr Remote Sensing, 209C Robinson Hall, Newark, DE 19716 USA.\\nEM joyoung@udel.edu; xiaohai@udel.edu; pan@triton.cms.udel.edu;\\n   mxhe@ns.qd.sd.cn; liu@pacific.jpl.nasa.gov\\nNR 20\\nTC 5\\nZ9 5\\nU1 0\\nU2 7\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

The DAS assimilates low-pass filtered surface velocity measurements, obtained from land-based high-frequency coastal radar arrays, into a primitive equation coastal ocean model using a sequential optimal interpolation scheme. Inhomogeneous and anisotropic estimates of the forecast error covariances required for the assimilation are assumed to be proportional to typical cross-correlations between modeled variables. These correlations are estimated from an ensemble of model simulations for 18 different summers. Similarly, the observation error covariances are assumed to be proportional to the actual covariances of the observations. A time-distributed averaging procedure (TDAP) that effectively low-pass filters the model forecast for comparison with the observations and introduces the corrections to the model state gradually over time is used in order to overcome problems of data compatibility and initialization. The correlations between direct subsurface current measurements and subsurface currents obtained from model-only and assimilation experiments for the summer of 1998 are 0.42 and 0.78, respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of the DAS. Our estimates of the error covariances are shown to be appropriate through a series of objective statistical tests. Analysis of the term balances of the model equations show that the dominant modeled dynamical balances are preserved by the DAS and that uncertainties in the spatial variability of the wind forcing are likely to be one source of model error. By varying the relative magnitudes of the estimated forecast and observation error covariances the DAS is shown to be most effective when approximately 80% of the analysis is made up of the model solution.\\nC1 Oregon State Univ, Coll Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.\\nRP Oke, PR (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Sch Math, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.\\nEM petero@maths.unsw.edu.au; jallen@coas.oregonstate.edu;\\n   miller@coas.oregonstate.edu; egbert@coas.oregonstate.edu;\\n   kosro@coas.oregonstate.edu\\nRI Oke, Peter R/C-5127-2011\\nOI Oke, Peter R/0000-0002-3163-5610; Kosro, P.

By averaging the data along isopycnal surfaces in a 0.5degrees x 0.5degrees grid, the authors are able to show many detailed phenomena associated with the narrow western boundary currents, including the vertical structure of the bifurcation latitude of the South Equatorial Current (SEC) and the connection between the Solomon and Coral Seas. The bifurcation latitude of the SEC is found to move southward from about 15degreesS near the surface to south of 22degreesS in the intermediate layers. The origin of the Great Barrier Reef Undercurrent (GBRUC) is identified to be at about 22degreesS. Farther to the north, the GBRUC intensifies underlying the surface East Australian Current, and merges with the North Queensland Current (NQC) at about 15degreesS. The NQC turns eastward to flow along the Papua New Guinea coast and feeds into the New Guinea Coastal Undercurrent (NGCUC) through the Louisiade Archipelago. Further analysis shows that there is a strong water property connection between the Coral and Solomon Seas, confirming the earlier speculation on the water mass origins of the NGCUC.\\nC1 Univ Hawaii Manoa, Int Pacific Res Ctr, SOEST, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.\\n   NASA, Off Earth Sci, Washington, DC 20546 USA.\\nRP Qu, TD (通讯作者)，Univ Hawaii Manoa, Int Pacific Res Ctr, SOEST, 2525 Correa Rd, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.\\nEM tangdong@soest.hawaii.edu\\nOI Lindstrom, Eric/0000-0002-4393-2276\\nNR 49\\nTC 74\\nZ9 76\\nU1 0\\nU2 14\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA\\nSN 0022-3670\\nEI 1520-0485\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

In December 1998 we made a short exploratory cruise between Valdivia (40degreesS) and Concepcion (37.8degreesS) taking temperature, salinity, oxygen, and current velocity profiles. Coincident sea surface temperature and color measurements were obtained by satellite. The results showed an area dominated by wind-induced coastal upwelling, river runoff, intrusion of offshore eddies, mixing, and heating. Upwelling centers were found over the shelf at three locations: inshore of Mocha Island, off Valdivia, and off Lavapie Point. At these centers, equatorial subsurface water (ESSW) intrudes into the coastal waters, sometimes affecting the surface waters. Since ESSW has characteristically low-oxygen and high-salinity values, it is easily detected. Off Valdivia, runoff imparts stratification, while farther north, solar heating and reduced mixing may facilitate stratification. In some areas, even strong winds would not destroy the stratification imparted by the advection of buoyancy that occurs during the upwelling process. Strong equatorward currents (>1 m s(-1)) in the form of an upwelling jet were found off Lavapie Point. This is also the location of an intruding anticyclone. Elsewhere, currents were mainly northward but highly variable because of intrusions from offshore eddies. The sea surface temperature and ocean color images show a complex field of onshore and offshore intrusions combined with the effects of mixing on chlorophyll concentrations. The residence time of upwelled water on the shelf is estimated to be less than 1 week.\\nC1 Old Dominion Univ, Ctr Coastal Phys Oceanog, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA.\\n   Univ Concepcion, Dept Fis Atmosfera & Oceano, Concepcion, Chile.\\n   NASA, SeaWIFS Project, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.\\n   NASA, SAIC, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.\\nRP Atkinson, LP (通讯作者)，Old Dominion Univ, Ctr Coastal Phys Oceanog, 768 W 52nd St, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA.\\nEM atkinson@ccpo.odu.edu; dfiguero@udec.cl; ricardo@porfc.udec.cl;\\n   vagallar@udec.cl; wschnei@udec.cl; mschmidt@gsfc.nasa.gov\\nRI De Pol-Holz, Ricardo/E-3740-2013\\nOI De Pol-Holz, Ricardo/0000-0002-3281-8232\\nNR 14\\nTC 32\\nZ9 32\\nU1 0\\nU2 9\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

Velocity in this frequency range is episodic, has a typical magnitude of 10 cm s(-1) and often reaches twice this speed. The NRE is a sub-estuary of the Albemarle-Pamlico Estuarine System (APES), which is the second largest estuarine complex and the largest lagoonal estuary in the United States. The astronomical tide in the NRE is negligible, owing to the APES\\'s virtual isolation from the coastal ocean by the North Carolina outer Banks barrier island chain.\\n   The episodic nature of the velocity signal together with the lack of an astronomical tide suggest that the semi-diurnal signal in the NRE is generated within the APES/NRE, presumably due to meteorological forcing. In the absence of a tidal current, this motion plays a significant role in determining the position and strength of the salt wedge, the thickness of the diffusive bottom boundary layer and the overall dispersion characteristics of the system. The episodic nature of the semi-diurnal signal encouraged us to pursue the use of nonstationary timeseries analysis techniques in the present study. We found wavelet analysis to be a highly effective technique for discriminating times when the semi-diurnal motion was strong and for identifying a predominant 13.2 h period in the along channel component of both 10-week wintertime and 10-week summertime current meter records. Model runs using idealized wind forcing to excite the vertically integrated version of the ADCIRC finite element circulation model indicated that the APES has a natural mode oscillation period of 13.2 h, an average \"seiche depth\" of 3.5 m and a \"seiche length\" of 139 km. This length is close to that of the long axis of Pamlico Sound, although the depth is approximately 25 percent less than the sound\\'s 4.5 m mean bathymetric depth. Model runs using observed winds from Cape Hatteras reproduced the seiching behavior of the system during both the wintertime and summertime observational periods. Seiche events appear to be excited by significant shifts in either the magnitude or direction of the wind field. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The model well reproduces the observed sea surface height (SSH) annual cycle and some current system such as the SCS Western Boundary Current (SCSWBC) system and the Kuroshio Loop Current (KLC). Four sensitivity experiments are carried out to reveal the dynamic mechanisms of the SCS circulation. The results show that most of the seasonal variability of the SCS is controlled predominantly by wind forcing. The Kuroshio affects the mean SSH significantly but contribute little to the variability. The SCSWBC system consists of the SCS Warm Current (SCSWC) and the Vietnam Coastal Current (VCC). In winter the SCSWBC splits into two branches separated at similar to14degrees-18degreesN. The northern branch is the SCSWC flowing northward and the southern branch is the VCC flowing southward. In summer, however, the SCSWBC flows unidirectionally northward from the Karimata Strait to the Taiwan Strait. The temporal variation of the SCSWBC, especially the VCC, is determined by the wind forcing over the interior SCS. Buoyancy forcing can strengthen (weaken) the summer (winter) SCSWBC. The KLC is crucial to the SCS circulation north of 18degreesN. It ultimately determines the appearance of the SCSWC in winter.\\nC1 Univ Wisconsin, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Madison, WI 53706 USA.\\n   Ocean Univ Qingdao, Phys Oceanog Lab, Qingdao 266003, Peoples R China.\\n   Chinese Acad Sci, S China Sea Inst Oceanol, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.\\nRP Yang, HJ (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, 1225 W Dayton St, Madison, WI 53706 USA.\\nEM haijunyang@facstaff.wisc.edu\\nRI WANG, DongXiao/B-4445-2012\\nOI WANG, DongXiao/0000-0001-8778-2188\\nNR 38\\nTC 73\\nZ9 81\\nU1 2\\nU2 28\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

Compared to the earlier application, the main upgrade is a subgrid-scale plume-convection parameterization that replaces conventional grid-cell-wide convective adjustment. The different treatment of convection leads to some noticeable differences in some of the repeated sensitivity experiments. For example, in an experiment where sea ice salinity is assumed to be that of the upper ocean, thus neglecting the primary effect of sea ice formation and melting on the ocean\\'s buoyancy forcing, Antarctic Bottom Water formation comes essentially to a halt, the global deep-ocean properties and thermohaline circulation thus being almost solely determined by North Atlantic Deep Water. The much weaker impact in the earlier estimate turns out to be mainly due to excessive open-ocean convection in the Southern Ocean, rendering that region susceptible to the open-ocean polynya mode. The associated melting in such polynyas leads to an enhancement of convection in a salty sea ice experiment, thus obscuring the effect of neglected brine release in coastal polynyas. Besides underscoring the necessity of a careful treatment of sea ice and convection in the Southern Ocean of a global OGCM, this study indicates that new-ice formation around Antarctica has a much larger effect on global deep-ocean properties and circulation than previously estimated.\\nC1 Texas A&M Univ, Dept Oceanog, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.\\n   Univ Victoria, Canadian Ctr Climate Modelling & Anal, Victoria, BC, Canada.\\nRP Stossel, A (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Oceanog, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.\\nEM achim@advect.tamu.edu\\nNR 70\\nTC 33\\nZ9 34\\nU1 0\\nU2 7\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA\\nSN 0022-3670\\nEI 1520-0485\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

[1999] found the exchange flow between the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea to be quasi-steady but far from satisfying the hydraulic control conditions for two-layered flows. Here we examine synoptic sections and use images from an acoustic backscatter system to provide the first detailed look at the flow and water mass changes in the Bosphorus and to assess how well the flow satisfies the hydraulic assumptions. Thirty kilometers long, 28-100 m deep, and 0.75-3 km wide, the Bosphorus has bathymetry for more complex than that used in analytic or numerical models of exchange flows. The particulars affect dynamics in important ways. For instance, owing to changes in channel shape, the narrowest section, known as the contraction, is not also the minimum in cross-sectional area. Rather, it is a transition between the wider northern half and the narrower southern half of the strait, and some places south of the contraction have slightly smaller areas. Sharp bends occur throughout the strait and often produce flow separations as well as directing upper and lower flows to opposite sides of the channel. Never <28% of the water column, the interface thickens to 75% in the southern half of the strait as a result of intense mixing downstream of the contraction. As a consequence of the strong mixing and numerous flow separations, we conclude that the exchange flow may be at least partly controlled by friction instead of being a simple hydraulic flow.\\nC1 Univ Washington, Appl Phys Lab, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.\\n   Univ Washington, Coll Ocean & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.\\n   Middle E Tech Univ, Inst Marine Sci, TR-33731 Erdemli, Icel, Turkey.\\nRP Gregg, MC (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Appl Phys Lab, 1013 NE 40th St, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.\\nEM gregg@apl.washington.edu\\nRI Özsoy, Emin/M-6055-2017\\nOI Özsoy, Emin/0000-0002-1519-0471\\nNR 27\\nTC 68\\nZ9 70\\nU1 0\\nU2 11\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

To understand better the role of modern (post-1955) carbon burial in continental slope sediments, we quantified rates of recent (defined as < 10(2)-yr timescale) sediment accumulation, particle mixing, and organic carbon burial for 12 cores from 10 upper slope stations (212-1004 m) in the proximity of Cape Hatteras. Recent sedimentation and mixing rates were evaluated using diagenetic models calibrated by coupling two modern particle tracers with distinct input functions: excess (210)Pb and fallout Pu. These two radionuclides provide independent information that can be used to deconvolve the effects of sediment accumulation and mixing. Recent sedimentation rates range from 10 to 425 cm. kyr(-1) (mean = 106 cm kyr(-1)) and biodiffusion coefficients for the deep mixing layer (9-21 cm) range from 0.3 to 5.2 cm(2) yr(-1) (mean = 1.3cm(2) yr(-1)). Total carbon burial for this region based on recent sedimentation rates (1.1 mol C m(-2) yr(-1)) is considerably higher than that reported for the more northern sections of the MAR Although the narrowing shelf and convergence of southward flowing shelf waters and the north-flowing Gulf Stream promote carbon export and deposition off Cape Hatteras, we estimate that modern carbon burial in upper slope sediments in this region accounts for much less than 1% of the shelf production.

The highest Delta(14)C values for both DOC (up to -29parts per thousand) and POC (up to 78parts per thousand) were observed in relatively low-salinity shelf waters. The Delta(14)C values for DOC from the shelf and shallow (similar to 5 m depth) slope generally increased progressively with proximity to the coast, and along-shelf from northeast to southwest. A significant system-wide increase in Delta(14)C-DOC values occurred between spring and summer 1996, indicating a major flux of young DOC to the MAB over this timeframe. The lowest Delta(14)C-DOC values (as low as -476parts per thousand) were found in deep (greater than or similar to300m depth) slope waters, and they were lower than values measured previously at similar depths in the open North Atlantic. A significant inverse relationship was found between Delta(14)C-DOC and delta(13)C-DOC for shelf and shallow slope waters, which we speculate may be due to variable contributions of young, C-14-enriched organic matter of terrestrial and/or riverine origin. The suspended POC of shelf and shallow slope waters was isotopically distinct from DOC, and exhibited little of the characteristic areal variability of DOC concentrations and Delta(14)C across the MAB. In deep slope waters, suspended POC had the greatest ages ever observed for water column POC in any marine system. These C-14-depleted POC values correlated positively and significantly with delta(13)C-POC values, which ranged from -31parts per thousand. to -23parts per thousand. in deep slope waters. A multiple-source dual isotopic mass balance model was applied to the observed Delta(14)C and delta(13)C distributions to evaluate the potential sources of DOC and POC to shelf and slope waters of the MAB. With the exception of the highly C-14- and C-13-depleted POC from the deep slope, all other DOC and POC values could be constrained by the isotopic signatures of various potential source materials measured for the MAB region. These include varying contributions from potential sources of open ocean, terrestrial and riverine, and bottom nepheloid layer colloidal organic matter, as well as from recent shelf and slope primary production.

There were significant interannual differences in catch of age-0 pollock, but transect and habitat differences (inshore vs. front vs. offshore) were not significant for either catch or size of pollock. There were significant variations in length-specific weight and growth of pollock, but the trends were inconsistent. Copepods dominated the zooplankton biomass in all habitats and years; there were no consistent differences in the densities of the dominant zooplankton taxa among the habitats. There were, however, strong habitat and transect differences in juvenile pollock diet, particularly for the larger and presumably rarer prey taxa (euphausiids, chaetognaths, fish). We did not find any evidence that occupying a particular habitat was beneficial to young pollock, although other factors (e.g. bioenergetic advantage and predation refuge) that we did not examine here could have been more variable and critical to pollock survival. In a physically dynamic system such as the Pribilof Islands, age-0 pollock may need to continuously search for optimal conditions of high prey availability and low predation pressure.

Surprisingly high Ra-228 concentrations of about 210 dpm m(-3) in the surface mixed layer were observed. The concentration decreased considerably, from >200 dpm m(-3) at 25m to similar to 43 dpm m(-3) at 200m, then increased to 87 dpm m(-3) at 300m close to the bottom (460 m), coincident with the typical distribution pattern of Ra-228 in open oceans. Concentrations of dissolved and particulate Th-228 ranged from similar to 45 to similar to 27 dpm m(-3) and from similar to 40 to similar to 10 dpm m(-3), respectively, and showed a general decrease with increasing depth. A Th-234 deficit relative to U-238 was also observed in the upper 150 m, as quantified by beta -counting. The upward flux of nitrate into the euphotic zone was calculated by the coupled Ra-228-nitrate approach and further converted into a new production of 4.4 mmol C m(-2) d(-1) based on a Redfield ratio of 6.6 for C:N. The Th-234-U-238 disequilibrium and the measured ratio of POC to particulate Th-234 yielded a POC export flux of 5.7 minol C m(-2) d(-1), which is in general agreement with the new production derived from nutrient budgets. POC export based on the Th-228-Ra-228 disequilibrium. was estimated to be 1.7 mmol C m(-2) d(-1), significantly lower than the derived new production. DOC transport or accumulation, data uncertainties and the different time scales to which the various methods were applied could be reasons for the discrepancy. The vertical fluxes of nitrate and phosphate to the euphotic zone bear a N/P molar ratio of 35, which is significantly higher than the Redfield ratio and suggests P-limitation in the southern South China Sea.

These particles are composed mainly of olivine and glass with minor chromite and traces of NiFe-sulfides. Some particles have inclusions of unmelted mineral and rock fragments from the precursor asteroid. Although all samples of melt rock examined have experienced significant alteration since their deposition in the late Pliocene, a significant portion of these particles have interiors that remain pristine and can be used to estimate the bulk composition of the impact melt. The bulk composition of the melt-rock particles is similar to the composition of basaltic meteorites such as howardites or mesosiderite silicates, with a contribution from seawater salts and a siderophile-rich component. There is no evidence that the Eltanin impact melt contains a significant terrestrial silicate component that might have been incorporated by mixing of the projectile with oceanic crust. If terrestrial silicates were incorporated into the melt, then their contribution must be much <10wt%. Since excess K, Na, and Cl are not present in seawater proportions, uptake of these elements into the melt must have been greatest for K and least for Cl, producing a K/Cl ratio about 4 times that in seawater. After correcting for the seawater component, the bulk composition of the Eltanin impact melt provides the best estimate of the bulk composition of the Eltanin asteroid. Excess Fe in the impact melt, relative to that in howardites, must be from a significant metal phase in the parent asteroid. Although the estimated Fe:Ni:Ir ratios (8:1:4 x 10(-5)) are similar to those in mesosiderite metal nodules (10: 1:6 x 10-5), excess Co and Au by factors of about 2 and 10 times, respectively, imply a metal component distinct from that in typical mesosiderites. An alternative interpretation, that siderophiles have been highly fractionated from a mesosiderite source, would require loss of about 90% of the original metal from the impact melt and the sediments, and is unsupported by any observational data. More likely, the excess Fe in the melt rocks is representative of the amount of metal in the impacting asteroid, which is estimated to be 4 +/- 1 wt%. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Chlorophyll concentrations ranged highest (> 10 mg m(-3)) during March. Peak values were associated with subsurface maxima near the shelf edge, which were dominated by larger ( > 8 mum) phytoplankton. In July, chlorophyll concentrations were generally lower with higher proportions associated with the < 8 mum size fraction. Primary production was determined using a wavelength-resolved photosynthesis-irradiance model. Model performance was evaluated by comparison of modeled and measured estimates of optical properties and simulated in situ primary production. Regional patterns of primary production determined using the model revealed high water-column-integrated primary production during March (>2.0 g cm(-2) d(-1)) in association with the shelf-slope front. In contrast, highest values in July (>3.0 g C m(-2) d(-1)) were associated with an intrusion of high-salinity, high-nutrient water into the southern portion of the study region. Average shelf-wide productivities were 1.3 g C m(-2) d(-1) in March and 2.1 g C M-2 d(-1) in July. Contemporaneous Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer sea-surface temperature imagery revealed that regions of high productivity were proximal to Gulf Stream circulation features. In March, cross-shelf sections of hydrographic properties and nutrients provided evidence for onshore displacement of the shelf-slope front, apparently related to the combined effects of the strong winds prior to the cruise and the offshore presence of energetic Gulf Stream processes. We speculate that variable forcing, related to the dynamics of the Gulf Stream and wind, resulted in significant frontal displacement and frontal velocity fluctuations leading to enhanced mixing and injection of nutrients across the frontal boundary. In July, Gulf Stream circulation, in conjunction with upwelling favorable conditions, resulted in a subsurface intrusion of high-nutrient water onto the shelf analogous to similar phenomena observed in the South Atlantic Bight. Localized regions of enhanced productivity appear to be quantitatively important in the overall carbon/nitrogen budget of the southern Mid-Atlantic Bight shelf. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Grain size, measured here as mineral-specific surface area, explained 55% of the variance in organic matter concentrations. Organic loadings, as ratios of organic carbon to surface area (OC:SFA), decrease with water column and core depth. OC:SFA ratios in this region are comparable to those found in areas with anoxic water columns, and are the highest reported for shelf-slope sediments underlying oxygenated water columns. With increasing water-column depth, organic matter becomes progressively incorporated into low-density (<2.4 g cm(-3)), organomineral aggregates, reflecting the increase in clay content in sediments with water-column depth. Organic coverage of mineral surfaces was determined by gas sorption methods; throughout the depth range minerals are essentially bare of organic coatings, in spite of high organic loadings. EHAA concentrations increase with water-column depth in a similar fashion as OC concentrations, and help to support intense heterotrophic communities at depth. Rapidly decreasing ratios of EHAA to total organic matter with water-column depth are consistent with previous inferences that largely refractory organic matter is exported from the shelf to the slope. Significant burial of EHAA downcore indicates protection of enzymatically hydrolyzable biopolymers with depth. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Stable isotope analyses of five species of sexually mature North Pacific salmon from Alaska (Oncorhynchus spp.) cluster into three groups: chinook salmon (D. tshawytscha) have the highest values, followed by coho (O. kisutch), with chum (O. keta), sockeye (O. nerka), and pink (O. gorbuscha) together having the lowest values. Although detailed isotopic data on salmon prey are lacking, there are limited data on relevant prey items from areas in which they are found in high abundance. These data suggest that the characteristics of the sockeye, pink and chum we have analyzed are compatible with their diets including open ocean squid and zooplankton, which are in general agreement with stomach content analyses. Isotope relationships between muscle and scale show consistent relationships for both delta(13)C (R-2=0.98) and delta(15)N (R-2=0.90). Thus, scales, which have been routinely archived for many systems, can be used for retrospective analyses. Archived sockeye salmon scales spanning 1966-1999 from Red Lake, Kodiak Island, Alaska were analyzed for their stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen. The delta(15)N record displays a decreasing trend of similar to3parts per thousand from 1969-1982 and an increasing trend of similar to3parts per thousand from 1982-1992, while the variations in delta(13)C are relatively minor. These trends may result from factors such as shifts in trophic level of feeding and/or feeding location, or may originate at the base of the food web via changes in processes such as nutrient cycling or primary productivity. Detailed studies on prey isotopic variability and its controls are needed to distinguish between these factors, and thus to improve the use of stable isotope analysis as a tool to learn more about present and past ecosystem change in the North Pacific and its relation to climatic change.

Here we compare export fluxes during bloom and steady-state situations near the Antarctic Polar Front in the SE Atlantic.\\n   In a previous expedition during the austral spring, we observed the development of a bloom that led to the sudden export of particles (Deep-Sea Res. II 44 (1997) 457). Here we report the results of a second expedition to the same area in summer (December-January), 3 years later. Th-234 was monitored in the surface water and in Rosette casts down to a 2 water depth of 500 m as tracer of export production in an intensive sampling program within a box of 275 x 375 km. The distribution of particulate and dissolved Th-234 was remarkably constant over time and location. Total (dissolved + particulate) Th-234 activities were depleted relative to its parent U-238 at the surface (Th-234/U-238 activity ratio approximately 83 %), reaching equilibrium at a depth of around 190 m. This constant depletion corresponds to a Th-234 export rate of 1115 dpm/m(2)/d, 35% of the value observed during the spring bloom. Below 80m depth, Th-234 on suspended particles correlates well with both particulate organic carbon (POC) and particulate biogenic silica (BSi), with a POC/Th-234 ratio of 10.2 +/- 0.8 mumol/dpm and a BSi/Th-234 ratio of 2.9 +/- 0.2 mumol/dpm. Using these ratios, the export from the upper 190m is calculated to be 11.3 mmol C/m(2)/d and 3.2mmol Si/m(2)/d. The export rates from the /d and 2.5 mmol Si/m(2)/d. surface mixed layer (at 100 m depth) are 8.8 mmol C/m(2)\\n   Thus, whereas in spring we had observed a sudden increase from a negligible to a high export rate, the summer situation around the Polar Front was characterized by a lower but steady export rate. This summer flux contributes a similar fraction to the annual export budget as the previously observed spring bloom, which has higher export rates but a much shorter duration.

At both sites, resident cells exhibited nutrient stress (F-v/F-m < 0.3). Shipboard perturbation experiments examined two light (mean in situ and elevated) and two Fe (nominally 0.5 and 3 nM) treatments under silicic acid-replete conditions. Mean in situ light levels (derived from incident irradiances, mixed layer depths (MLDs), wind stress, and a published vertical mixing model) differed at the two sites, 25% of incident irradiance I-0 at 47degreesS and 9% I-0 at 54degreesS because of MLDs of 40 (47degreesS) and 90 m (54degreesS), when these stations were occupied. The greater MLD at 54degreesS is reflected by tenfold higher cellular chlorophyll a levels in the resident phytoplankton. In the 47 S experiment, chlorophyll a levels increased to >1 mug L-1 only in the high-Fe treatments, regardless of irradiance levels, suggesting Fe limitation. This trend was also noted for cell abundances, silica production, and carbon fixation rates. In contrast, in the 54degreesS experiment there were increases in chlorophyll a (to >2 mug L-1), cell abundances, silica production, and carbon fixation only in the high-light treatments to which Fe had been added, suggesting that Fe and irradiance limit algal growth rates. Irradiance by altering algal Fe quotas is a key determinant of algal growth rate at 54degreesS (when silicic acid levels are nonlimiting); however, because of the integral nature of Fe/light colimitation and the restricted nature of the current data set, it was not possible to ascertain the relative contributions of Fe and irradiance to the control of phytoplankton growth. On the basis of a climatology of summer mean MLD for subantarctic (SA) waters south of Australia the 47degrees and 54degreesS sites appear to represent minimum and maximum MLDs, where Fe and Fe/ irradiance, respectively, may limit/colimit algal growth. The implications for changes in the factors limiting algal growth with season in SA waters are discussed.\\nC1 Univ Otago, Dept Chem, Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Ctr Chem & Phys Oceanog, Dunedin 9001, New Zealand.\\n   Univ Tasmania, Inst Antarctic & So Ocean Studies, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.\\n   Univ Charleston, Grice Marine Lab, Charleston, SC 29412 USA.\\n   CSIRO, Div Marine Res, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.\\n   Univ Delaware, Coll Marine Studies, Lewes, DE 19958 USA.\\n   Ctr Oceanol Marseille, UMR CNRS 6535, Lab Oceanog & Biogeochim, F-13288 Marseille 09, France.\\n   Antarctic CRC, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.\\nRP Boyd, PW (通讯作者)，Univ Otago, Dept Chem, Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Ctr Chem & Phys Oceanog, Dunedin 9001, New Zealand.\\nEM pboyd@alkali.otago.ac.nz\\nRI Boyd, Philip W/J-7624-2014; Quéguiner, Bernard/B-4060-2008; Trull, Tom\\n   W/B-7028-2014; Hutchins, David A/D-3301-2013\\nOI Boyd, Philip W/0000-0001-7850-1911; Quéguiner,\\n   Bernard/0000-0001-5020-8297; Sedwick, Peter/0000-0003-0663-8323\\nNR 53\\nTC 97\\nZ9 97\\nU1 0\\nU2 20\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

In this region, tidal dynamics were found to be extremely sensitive both to the proximity of the continental shelf-slope break to the critical latitude psi (crit) and to the existence of a shelf break front. If the continental slope was not in the vicinity of psi (crit) or a shelf break front was absent, generation of internal tides was negligible. Generation of internal tides was greatest when both a shelf break front was present and the continental slope was near and equatorward of psi (crit). When a shelf break front was present and the continental slope was near but poleward of psi (crit), a strong benthic response occurred. This response included development of benthic inertial oscillations at the continental shelf-slope break, increased benthic shear, a thicker benthic boundary layer, and increased benthic dissipation. A shelf break front with even a slight horizontal density gradient was found to significantly enhance internal tide generation and/or the benthic effects.\\nC1 Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA.\\nRP Robertson, R (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Route 9W, Palisades, NY 10964 USA.\\nRI Robertson, Robin/T-5491-2019\\nNR 11\\nTC 32\\nZ9 32\\nU1 1\\nU2 2\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

Such an increase can be estimated on a global scale by combining satellite estimates of UV irradiance at the ocean surface from the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) satellite instrument with the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) satellite ocean color measurements in the visible spectral region. In this paper we propose a model of seawater optical properties in the UV spectral region based on the case I water model in the visible range. The inputs to the model are standard monthly SeaWiFS products: chlorophyll concentration and the diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm. Penetration of solar UV radiation to different depths in open ocean waters is calculated using the radiative transfer quasi-single scattering approximation (QSSA). The accuracy of the QSSA approximation in the water is tested using more accurate codes. Sensitivity studies of underwater UV irradiance to atmospheric and oceanic optical properties have shown that the main environmental parameters controlling absolute levels of UVB (280-320 nm) and DNA-weighted irradiance underwater are solar zenith angle, cloud transmittance, water optical properties, and total ozone. Monthly maps of underwater UV irradiance and DNA-weighted exposure are calculated using monthly mean SeaWiFS chlorophyll and diffuse attenuation coefficient, daily SeaWiFS cloud fraction data, and the TOMS-derived surface UV irradiance daily maps. The results include global maps of monthly average UVB irradiance and DNA-weighted daily exposures at 3 and 10 m and depths where the UVB irradiance and DNA-weighted dose rate at local noon are equal to 10% of their surface values.\\nC1 Sci Syst Applicat Inc, Lanham, MD 20706 USA.\\n   Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Goddard Earth Sci & Technol Ctr, Baltimore, MD 21228 USA.\\n   NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, GEST Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.\\n   NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, SeaWiFS Project, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.\\n   Stanford Univ, Dept Geophys, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.\\n   SAIC Gen Sci Co, Greenbelt, MD USA.\\nRP Vasilkov, A (通讯作者)，Sci Syst Applicat Inc, 10210 Greenbelt Rd,Ste 400, Lanham, MD 20706 USA.\\nRI Krotkov, Nickolay A/E-1541-2012\\nOI Krotkov, Nickolay A/0000-0001-6170-6750; Arrigo,\\n   Kevin/0000-0002-7364-876X; Herman, Jay/0000-0002-9146-1632\\nNR 74\\nTC 42\\nZ9 42\\nU1 0\\nU2 18\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

The flow over this sill has been used as a typical example of two-dimensional hydraulics, with a lower layer that thins and accelerates as it moves downstream below an almost stagnant layer that widens downstream, creating a distinctive wedge shape. However, we find that rather than being stagnant, the velocity in this wedge-shaped layer is actually quite large, consisting of a swiftly recirculating dipole vortex during flood tide and a monopole vortex during ebb tide, though we may have missed the matching half of a dipole with our sampling during ebb. The recirculations during flood tide carry an amount of water equal to 25% of the tidal flux, while the monopole during ebb tide carries 20% of the tidal flux. These recirculations bias along-channel estimates of volume flux, especially in the middle wedge-shaped layer, and demonstrate that accurate volume fluxes in the lee wave are only possible if three-dimensional surveys are made. Our three-dimensional survey shows that there is a net isopycnal convergence of water in the middle layer at a rate adequate to close the. volume budget of the flow without recourse to diapycnal fluxes. We also calculate the strength of the vorticity in the recirculations observed during flood tide and attribute their formation to boundary layer separation.\\nC1 Oregon State Univ, Coll Ocean & Atoms Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.\\n   Univ Washington, Appl Phys Lab, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.\\n   Univ Washington, Sch Oceanog, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.\\nRP Klymak, JM (通讯作者)，Oregon State Univ, Coll Ocean & Atoms Sci, 104 Ocean Adm Bldg, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.\\nEM jklymak@oce.orst.edu\\nRI Klymak, Jody M/A-3041-2008; Klymak, Jody M./AAD-7557-2021\\nOI Klymak, Jody M/0000-0003-4612-8600; Klymak, Jody M./0000-0003-4612-8600\\nNR 32\\nTC 46\\nZ9 46\\nU1 0\\nU2 5\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

This technique uses physical models of ocean surface waves and electromagnetic backscattering from a rough surface at intermediate angles of incidence to generate predictions of the normalized radar cross section (NRCS, or sigma (0)) of the ocean surface for a given wind friction velocity and observational geometry. The ocean spectral model used in this technique has been developed specifically for this application. It combines in situ wave measurements at low wave numbers with the Phillips [1985] equilibrium spectral model. This choice of ocean wave model is supported by a set of open ocean wave measurements summarized in this paper. A suite of models, derived from both in situ and remote measurements of the sea surface, is used to characterize the directional spreading of ocean waves relative to the wind direction. The resulting two-dimensional ocean wave spectra are used with a composite surface model to predict radar backscattering from the ocean surface at C-band. These radar cross-section predictions are combined with ERS-1 scatterometer measurements in a cost function minimization scheme to yield estimates of the friction velocity vector at the ocean surface. We present examples of this technique and compare friction velocity retrievals obtained via this scheme with buoy-based measurements under a variety of wind and wave conditions. On the basis of the analysis of a limited number of cases, this technique yielded friction velocity estimates for which the magnitude was within 22% and the direction was within +/- 25 degrees. Given that scientific applications require magnitude estimates within 10-15% and directional estimates within +/- 20 degrees of in situ measurements, these preliminary results suggest that this is a promising approach to wind retrieval.\\nC1 Univ Washington, Appl Phys Lab, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.\\n   Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Baskin Sch Engn, Dept Elect Engn, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.\\n   Univ Michigan, Dept Atmospher Ocean & Space Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.\\nRP Lettvin, EE (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Appl Phys Lab, 1013 NE 40th St, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.\\nEM ellenl@apl.washington.edu; jfv@engin.umich.edu\\nNR 70\\nTC 2\\nZ9 2\\nU1 0\\nU2 1\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

Downcore sediment profiles from four sites, which represent 50-200yr of deposition, were also examined to assess long-term changes in organic matter accumulation in this region. The Atchafalaya \"mud stream,\" which transports fine sediment westward parallel to the coastline, appears to play an important role in the transport of river-derived organic matter. In general, sedimentary organic carbon (%OC) and total nitrogen (%TN) decrease seaward within each transect and westward along the shelf. Atomic organic carbon: nitrogen (C/N) ratios indicative of a terrestrial source (> 20) are observed near the mouth of the river during each sampling period, but values along the remainder of the shelf fall within a narrow range (9-11) with no apparent offshore trends. Depleted stable carbon isotope (delta C-13) values typical of C3 plant debris (-27 parts per thousand) are found near the river mouth and become more enriched (-22 to -21 parts per thousand) offshore. Organic matter distribution throughout much of the study area is similar during each sampling period, with significant seasonal differences close to the river mouth.\\n   Sediment, particulate organic carbon (POC), and particulate organic nitrogen (PON) budgets constructed for the study area reveal that 31 % of the sediment exported by the Atchafalaya River is presently deposited within the study area annually, while the organic matter burial rates in the same region represent only 21% and 22% of the riverine POC and PON inputs, respectively. The POC and PON budgets also suggest that the organic matter remineralized in the water column is of algal origin (C/ N = 7.2), whereas riverine organic matter (C/N = 10) appears to be respired within the sediments. The 22.7 g POC m(-2) yr(-1) and 2.7 g PON m(-2) yr(-1) buried in the study area account for similar to 5 % of the combined riverine and autochthonous OC and ON inputs to this region of the Louisiana shelf.

A simple impulse-momentum approach explains simulation results and forms the basis for adding an acceleration-related term to widely used energetics sediment transport formulae. Transport predicted by the acceleration term becomes increasingly significant as wave shape approaches the sawtooth profile characteristic of surf zone bores. Simulations integrate F=ma and a corresponding set of equations for the torques for each sphere. Normal and tangential forces between contacting particles are linear functions of the distance between sphere centers and the relative tangential displacement at the contact point, respectively; particle interactions are both inelastic and frictional. Pressure gradient forces generated by the passage of surface gravity waves drive fluid and particle motion in a stack of thin horizontal fluid layers that exchange momentum and exert fluid drag, added mass, and buoyancy forces on particles. Transport properties of the simulated granular-fluid assemblage are robust to large variations in material properties of the particles. Simulated transport rates agree with available experimental data for unsteady transport of coarse sands; the mode of bed load motion, dispersion of bed load particles, and particle segregation by size and density are qualitatively consistent with available particle-scale observations of bed load transport of natural particles.\\nC1 N Carolina State Univ, Dept Marine Earth & Atmospher Sci, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.\\n   N Carolina State Univ, Dept Phys, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.\\nRP Drake, TG (通讯作者)，N Carolina State Univ, Dept Marine Earth & Atmospher Sci, Box 8208, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.\\nEM drake@ncsu.edu; joe@unity.ncsu.edu\\nNR 56\\nTC 218\\nZ9 218\\nU1 0\\nU2 38\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

The most recently published correction algorithm for the EMR1 data [Stum et al., 1998] is applied. The suggested drift correction for TMR data [Keihm et al., 1998, 2000] is also evaluated. The corrected EMR1 data (1991-1996) produce a global (to +/- 66 degrees the T/P latitude range) long-term mean wet troposphere correction 6 and 13 mm lower than TMR and ECMWF, respectively. The EMR2 data (1995-1999) yield a mean wet troposphere correction 2 and 9 mm lower than TMR and ECMWF, respectively. After removing mean differences all three microwave radiometers reproduce similar long-term zonal wet troposphere corrections compared to the ECMWF model (10-14 mm rms) and to each other (5-9 nim rms) with some zonally periodic differences, most < 10 mm. The ECMWF model shows variations compared to the radiometers of over 30 mm before 1995, about 20-30 mm from 1995 to 1997, and up to 20 mm from 1998 to 1999. The intersatellite differences include a latitudinally dependent annual signal, reaching 10 nun in amplitude. Before correcting for the TMR drift there exists a global relative TMR-EMR1 drift of -1.6 +/- 0.4 mm y(-1), from 1992 to 1996. After correcting for the TMR drift the TMR-EMR I trend is reduced to -0.4 +/- 0.2 mm. y(-1), supporting the TMR drift correction. The TMR-EMR2 trend changes sign (direction) after an anomaly that occurred in one of the EMR2 brightness temperatures during June 1996. Before the anomaly, with (without) the TMR correction the relative TMR-EMR2 trend is -3.0 +/- 1.9 (4.0 +/- 2.1) nun y(-1), again supporting the TMR drift correction. After the anomaly, through 1997 the TMR-EMR trend is 3.7 +/- 1.2 mm y(-1), and from 1998 to 1999 it is 0.8 +/- 0.6 mm y(-1).\\nC1 Univ Texas, Ctr Space Res, Austin, TX 78759 USA.\\n   NASA, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA.\\n   Ohio State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn & Geodet Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.\\nRP Urban, TJ (通讯作者)，Univ Texas, Ctr Space Res, 3925 W Braker Lane,Suite 200, Austin, TX 78759 USA.\\nEM urban@csr.utexas.edu\\nOI Shum, C K/0000-0001-9378-4067; Tapley, Byron/0000-0003-3689-5750\\nNR 40\\nTC 8\\nZ9 9\\nU1 0\\nU2 3\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

This implementation facilitates prescription of model boundary conditions directly from altimetric measurements (both T/P and ERS-2). The expected error characteristics for a domain of this size with periodically updated boundary conditions are established with idealized numerical experiments using simulated data. A hindcast simulation is then constructed using actual altimetric observations during the period October 1992 through September 1998. Quantitative evaluation of the simulation suggests significant skill. The correlation coefficient between predicted sea level anomaly and ERS observations in the model interior is 0.89; that for predicted versus observed dynamic height anomaly based on hydrography at the BATS site is 0.73. Comparison with the idealized experiments suggests that the main source of error in the hindcast is temporal undersampling of the boundary conditions.

Interannual oscillations with periods of around 3-4 years are found to dominate the variability in this region. Anomalous atmospheric patterns periodically reach the \\'Weddell Sea from the west and perturb the sea ice circulation and distribution in the Weddell Gyre through changes in the intensity and direction of the climatological winds. Sea ice accumulates in the southeastern Weddell Sea every 3-4 years owing to two atmospherically driven processes: (1) weak ice export to the north due to a weak northward branch of the gyre (driven by weak southerly winds) and (2) large ice import from the east due to a strong East Wind Drift (driven by strong easterly winds along the coast). The opposite situation gives rise to a depletion of sea ice in the same region half a cycle later. Sea ice anomalies are then advected north-northeastward before turning eastward in the gyre circulation. The eastward propagation of ice anomalies along the ice margin accounts for the passage of the Antarctic Circumpolar Wave through the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. A low frequency signal is also detected in the Weddell Sea variations, albeit rather speculatively in this 20-year-long record. Sea ice variability on this timescale appears to be associated with a change in the shape and characteristics of the Weddell Gyre circulation around 1990. This mode of variability implicates feedbacks between the gyre and Weddell Deep Water temperature variations, whose impact is observed near the Maud Rise topographic feature.\\nC1 Univ Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Inst Astron Phys & Geophys, Danish Ctr Earth Syst Sci, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.\\n   European Space Agcy, Estec, Oceans Ice Unit,APP, FSO, NL-2200 AG Noordwijk, Netherlands.\\n   CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA USA.\\nRP Venegas, SA (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Inst Astron Phys & Geophys, Danish Ctr Earth Syst Sci, Juliane Maries Vej 30, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.\\nEM silvia@dcess.ku.dk; mark.drinkwater@esa.int\\nRI Drinkwater, Mark/C-2478-2011\\nOI Drinkwater, Mark/0000-0002-9250-3806\\nNR 66\\nTC 46\\nZ9 52\\nU1 1\\nU2 13\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

The seasonal cycle begins in spring when a surface-intensified baroclinic equatorward jet develops next to the coast in response to strong upwelling favorable winds. This jet, and a developing eddy field, then moves offshore during summer and fall. The EKE maximum associated with the jet progresses only as far as 127 degreesW, beyond which it decreases rapidly. This is a robust characteristic of the seasonal cycle that has been previously attributed only to an unspecified dissipation process. To investigate this aspect of the surface EKE, a multiyear simulation of the CC is carried out using the Dietrich/Center for Air-Sea Technology primitive equation regional ocean model [Dietrich, 1997]. The simulation accurately reproduces many aspects of the observed annual cycle, including the offshore propagation of the EKE at the surface. The model results indicate that the decrease of surface EKE west of 127 degreesW in the simulation is not due to dissipation but rather is caused by the vertical redistribution of EKE to the deep ocean. This redistribution occurs through the transformation of kinetic energy from the vertical shear flow to the vertical mean flow. The transformation is a nonlinear process inherently associated with the life cycle of baroclinically unstable waves, and in the CC, it effectively energizes the deeper ocean at the expense of the upper ocean. The process is also known to be important in the atmosphere [Wiin-Nielsen, 1962]. Taken together, the recent California Current observations and the new model results strongly suggest that the CC regularly supplies EKE to the deep waters of the eastern North Pacific.\\nC1 USN, Postgrad Sch, Dept Meteorol, Monterey, CA 93943 USA.\\n   AcuSea Inc, Albuquerque, NM 87112 USA.\\nRP Haney, RL (通讯作者)，USN, Postgrad Sch, Dept Meteorol, 589 Dyer Rd,Rm 254, Monterey, CA 93943 USA.\\nEM rlhaney@nps.navy.mil\\nNR 22\\nTC 41\\nZ9 41\\nU1 2\\nU2 3\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

It is found that the rate of change of volume integrated salinity is governed by two processes: (1) the \"drift\" of the isohaline through the fluid, and (2) turbulent salt flux through the isohaline. This analysis highlights the role of turbulent salt flux in maintaining the salinity intrusion. In contrast, more standard budgets using a stationary, vertical cross section as the seaward end of the volume of integration attribute almost all along-estuary salt flux to advective processes such as the gravitational circulation. The isohaline budget is explored using an analytical model and using results from a three-dimensional numerical model. The numerical results highlight the complex spatial and temporal interplay between turbulent mixing and the shape of the isohaline. Averaging over a time period during which the freshwater volume behind the isohaline is constant reduces the isohaline budget to a balance of two terms: the time-mean, area-integrated turbulent salinity flux across the isohaline being equal to the mean river flow times the salinity of the isohaline.\\nC1 Univ Washington, Sch Oceanog, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.\\n   Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\nRP MacCready, P (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Sch Oceanog, Box 357940, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.\\nEM parker@ocean.washington.edu\\nNR 22\\nTC 50\\nZ9 50\\nU1 1\\nU2 7\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

Wet deposition of Saharan mineral aerosols may alleviate iron limitation of diazotrophic cyanophytes, which in turn fuel the nitrogen economy of red tides in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.

Basic near-wall turbulence structure and production mechanisms appear similar to the neutral case, though dampened. The state of turbulence in the stratified fluid is analyzed by graphing the relationships between key nondimensional parameters. A shifting and smearing of the curve of flux Richardson number Ri(f) versus turbulent Froude number Fr-t caused by the wavy boundary (compared with a flat boundary) demonstrates the higher level of turbulence near the wavy wall and shows strong mixing in the detached shear layer over the trough.

Sediment resuspension associated with Hurricane Edouard was forced by combined current and wave processes. Combined current-wave bottom shear stresses exceeded 3.5 dyn cm(-2), well above the shear stress for the observed resuspension, which was determined to be 0.8 dyn cm-2 Hortense sediment resuspension, however, was caused primarily by waves with little or no contribution from subtidal plus tidal currents; combined current-wave bottom shear stress reached 2 dyn cm(-2). Beam attenuation data reveal that bottom sediments were resuspended from -70 m depth to more than 30 m up into the water column during both hurricanes. The relaxation of sediments to pre-Edouard conditions occurred at about the same time at all depths, indicating advection and transport by subtidal currents. Analyses of optical data reveal that the resuspended sediments consisted mainly of detritus and relict pigments from the ocean bottom.\\nC1 Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Ocean Phys Lab, Goleta, CA 93117 USA.\\n   Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\nRP Chang, GC (通讯作者)，Florida Environm Res Inst, 4807 Bayshore Blvd,Suite 101, Tampa, FL 33611 USA.\\nEM grace@icess.ucsb.edu\\nNR 35\\nTC 59\\nZ9 63\\nU1 0\\nU2 5\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

An assessment of a semi-analytical theory of the cross-shelf variation of near-inertial current oscillations (Chen and Xie, 1997, Journal of Geophysical Research 102(C7), 15,583-15,593) indicates that, although instructive, the theory does not capture all the elements seen in numerical simulations. Here a purely analytical approach is taken. It assumes only that the cross-shelf currents are of the form AB cos ft, where B is an amplitude modifier (a function of the distance offshore) and f is the Coriolis parameter. The solution to the governing equations gives B = 1 - e(-x/L), where x is the distance offshore and L is a radius of deformation length scale. The solutions show that exponentially increasing current oscillations over continental shelves are actually a form of inertial-gravity waves. In non-equatorial regions, the effect of the sea surface pressure gradient is found to be in phase with that of the Coriolis effect but with a much larger magnitude over the inner continental shelves. The kinematic boundary condition results in the oscillating sea level setup and setdown, the resulting pressure gradient drives the oscillatory cross-shelf currents over the inner continental shelf, and the Coriolis effect results in a corresponding oscillatory flow in the longshore direction. One of the more notable findings is that the length scale L, referred to here as the inertial-gravity barotropic radius of deformation, is found to be significantly larger than the classical barotropic radius of deformation.

Temperature and salinity anomalies that form at the surface and spread throughout the deep winter mixed layer are sequestered beneath the mixed layer when it shoals in spring, and are then re-entrained into the surface layer in the subsequent fall and winter. Here we document this \\'re-emergence mechanism\\' in the North Pacific Ocean using observed SSTs, subsurface temperature fields from a data assimilation system, and coupled atmosphere-ocean model simulations. Observations indicate that the dominant large-scale SST anomaly pattern that forms in the North Pacific during winter recurs in the following winter. The model simulation with mixed layer ocean physics reproduced the winter-to-winter recurrence, while model simulations with observed SSTs specified in the tropical Pacific and a 50 m slab in the North Pacific did not. This difference between the model results indicates that the winter- to- winter SST correlations are the result of the re-emergence mechanism, and not of similar atmospheric forcing of the ocean in consecutive winters. The model experiments also indicate that SST anomalies in the tropical Pacific associated with El Nino are not essential for re-emergence to occur.\\n   The recurrence of observed SST and simulated SST and SSS anomalies are found in several regions in the central North Pacific, and are quite strong in the northern (> 50 degreesN) part of the basin. The winter-to-winter autocorrelation of SSS anomalies exceed those of SST, since only the latter are strongly damped by surface fluxes. The re-emergence mechanism also has a modest influence on MLD through changes in the vertical stratification in the seasonal thermocline.

Conventional sampling with nets, pumps, and bottles is discrete and covers only a small portion of the total variance spectrum. Development of the Video Plankton Recorder (VPR) has enabled us to quantify the abundance of seston and plankton, including delicate taxa, over a range of scales from centimeters to hundreds of kilometers. During the 1994-1995 GLOBEC Georges Bank field years, three VPR surveys were conducted across the bank from the Slope Water in the south to the Gulf of Maine in the north, a distance of similar to 200 km. The surveys, conducted in June 1994, January 1995, and March 1995, intersected at least four distinct water types (Slope Water, stratified bank water, well-mixed bank water, Gulf of Maine water) and crossed several frontal boundaries (shelf break front, tidal front, Gulf of Maine front). The Video Plankton Recorder was equipped with temperature, conductivity, fluorescence, and transmissivity probes in addition to two video cameras, permitting comparison of the plankton and particle distributions with the physical fields. Only data collected using the low-magnification camera are considered here. A combination of analytical methods including temperature-salinity-plankton plots and statistical analyses (spatial variance spectra, principle component analysis, and correlation analysis) revealed that the distribution of taxa and particles were associated with particular water mass types but that smaller-scale variability in plankton abundance did not appear to be tightly coupled to or correlated with hydrography. The distributions and seasonal progression in abundance of Calanus finmarchicus, the most abundant plankton taxon, revealed a deep dwelling population in the Slope Water and shallower populations on the bank and in the Gulf of Maine in January with abundance becoming increasingly greater on the bank in March and June. The data indicate that physical advection of water mass types and intrinsic plankton was important to the establishment of Calanus populations on Georges Bank. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

There is an early natural mortality that is mostly related to predation, which is followed by a physiologically-based mortality. Juvenile salmon that fail to reach a critical size by the end of their first marine summer do not survive the following winter. In this study we describe our initial tests of this critical size and critical period hypothesis using data from ocean surveys of juvenile salmon and from experimental feeding studies on coho. Conservative swept volume abundance estimates for juvenile coho, and possibly chinook, indicate that there is high mortality in fall and winter during their first year in the sea. Studies of otolith weight show that the length and otolith-weight relationship for young coho changes in the early fall of their first ocean year. Studies of growth and associated hormone levels in feeding studies show that slow growing juvenile coho are stunted and deficient in an insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). Juvenile coho sampled in September had low IGF-I values, indicative of poor growth. The results of these studies provide evidence for the general hypothesis that growth-related mortality occurs late in the first marine year and may be important in determining the strength of the year class (brood year). The link between total mortality and climate could be operating via the availability of nutrients regulating the food supply and hence competition for food (i.e. bottom-up regulation).

The speed at which particles sink and the factors that control sinking speed are of primary importance to the distribution of oceanic nutrient concentrations and to the preservation of biogenic material in the sediment record. Sequencing sediment trap collectors deployed at US JGOFS sites in the equatorial Pacific and Arabian Sea provided a time series of particle fluxes from which particle settling rates were estimated. A comparison of settling velocities obtained from 100-500 m (Pilskaln et al., Deep Sea Research 45 (1998) 1803) to settling velocities obtained for depths between 1000 and 3500 m indicate an increase of a factor of 2-10 between 100 and 2000 m and an increase of 15-60% between 2000 and 3500 m. The increase in settling velocity in the deep ocean is generally correlated with the loss Of C-org with depth. Lithogenic content does not appear to impact particle settling rate. Variability in particle settling rate is systematically related to physical forcing of the surface ocean in the Equatorial Pacific, but not in the Arabian Sea. The increase in particle settling rate with depth likely influences the delivery of CaCO3 to the sea floor. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The numerical domain covered the Gulf of Maine/Georges Bank region with an open boundary starting at the New Jersey coast and ending at the Nova Scotia coast, with increased spatial resolution over Georges Bank. Numerical experiments were conducted using both smoothed and non-smoothed high-resolution (15 s) bottom topography. The model was forced by specifying the M-2 elevation and phase on the open boundary, and several forms of the bottom roughness parameter z(0) were used. The model provided a reasonable simulation of the M-2 tidal elevations and currents. The model, when run as an initial value problem with early summer stratification, exhibited tidal mixing fronts around the 40-60m isobath over Georges Bank and Nantucket Shoals, and 100-m isobath on Brown Bank. The formation of these tidal mixing fronts significantly enhanced the along-isobath tidal rectified current over Georges Bank and the other two shoal regions. A cool-water band developed within the frontal zone along the eastern and southern Ranks of Georges Bank and Nantucket Shoal, and it became cooler owing to wind mixing and upwelling as a mean summer wind stress was added. Tidal mixing and turbulent dissipation varied in time asymmetrically over Georges Bank. Over Georges Bank, tidal mixing was generally characterized as a local 1-D balance between turbulent shear production and dissipation. The spatial structure of the tidal residual flow and local turbulent dissipation rate depended critically on the spatial resolution of the bottom topography and the spatial distribution of z(0). Analysis of the 3-D momentum balance and the residual flow over the center of Georges Bank indicates that earlier results based on a 2-D cross-bank model correctly captured the basic dynamics of stratified tidal rectification and tidal mixing in this idealized model setting.

In the Ross Sea, Antarctica., plankton biomass appears to be controlled by the seasonal recession of the sea ice and the formation of the Ross Sea polynya during the short austral spring-summer period. During four cruises in 1996-1997 within the southern Ross Sea as part of the US JGOFS program, we determined the abundances and biomasses of phototrophic and heterotrophic nanoplankton and microplankton primarily along a transect at 76 degrees 30\\'S. The colonial prymnesiophyte Phaeocystis antarctica (excluding mucus carbon) contributed significantly to community structure during both non-bloom and bloom periods (similar to 25% and 90%. respectively, of microbial biomass). However, shifts occurred both seasonally and spatially between a diatom/heterotrophic dinoflagellate and a colonial P. antarctica-dominated assemblage. While nanoplankton biomass varied < 50% during any particular cruise, PNAN and HNAN biomass ranged more than three orders of magnitude among the four cruises (0.1-359 and 1.5-268 mmol C m(-2) respectively). Cruise averages of PMIC biomass ranged from 2.5 to 530 mmol C m(-2), and a maximum biomass of 1530 mmol C m(-2) was observed during the bloom of colonial P. antarctica in summer. Average heterotrophic biomass was < 30% of the total microbial biomass (excluding bacteria) from early austral spring through summer. This value rose to approximate to 87% in autumn following the decline and disappearance of P. antarctica. The contribution of total nano- and microplankton biomass to POC in the upper 60 m over the three sampled seasons varied from 7% to 52.4% with an overall average of 21.8% for all four cruises which is comparable to contributions of these assemblages in other oceans even with the strong seasonal dominance of P. antarctica.

The Ross Sea experienced a bacterial bloom with an amplitude equaling similar blooms observed in the North Atlantic and North Pacific, reaching 3 x 10(9) cells l(-1) or 35 mmol C m(-2) in late January. Increases in bacterial biomass were driven both by increases in abundance and in cell volume. Cell volumes ranged from 0.03 mum(3) cell(-1) in early spring to over 0.15 mum(3) cell(-1) in midsummer. Larger cells were associated with faster division rates. Bacterial growth rates ranged 0.02-0.3 divisions d(-1), equal to rates at lower latitudes. Bacterial biomass accumulated steadily in the upper water column at a net rate of 0.03 d(-1). While there is clear evidence of a bacterial bloom in the Ross Sea, equal to bacterioplankton blooms observed in other oceanic systems, the magnitude of bacterial response relative to the phytoplankton bloom was modest. For example, euphotic zone bacterial production (BP) rates were equivalent to 1-10% of particulate primary production (PP) except in April 1997 when PP was very low and BP: PP was sometimes >1. BP integrated over the upper 300 m was a more substantial fraction of the overlying PP than BP in the euphotic zone alone, with bacterial carbon demand in the upper 300 m about 30% of the seasonal PP. There was significant seasonal variation of bacterial biomass below the euphotic zone, indicating dynamic bacterial growth in the lower layer, and a supply of labile organic matter for bacteria. Bacterial metabolism is apparently limited by DOC flux in the upper layer. There is little evidence of temperature limitation, independent of substrate concentration. The relatively small diagenesis of phytoplankton biomass in the euphotic zone implies that there is relatively more organic matter available to support bacterial metabolism in the lower water column.

Nitrate concentrations ([NO3]) and apparent oxygen utilization (AOU) decreased significantly in intermediate waters (by -0.6 and -2.9 mu mol kg(-1) respectively, at sigma (theta) = 27.4 kg m(-3), corresponding to approximate to 1050 m). In shallow waters (above roughly 750 m) [NO3-] and AOU increased, though the changes were not statistically significant. A sensitivity study with an ocean general circulation model indicates that reasonable perturbations of the biological carbon pump due to changes in export production or remineralization. efficiency are insufficient to account for the intermediate water tracer trends. However, changes in water ventilation rates could explain the intermediate water tracer trends and would be consistent with trends of water age derived from radiocarbon. Trends in AOU and [NO3-] provide relatively poor constraints on decadal scale trends in the marine biological carbon pump for two reasons. First, most of the expected changes due to decadal scale perturbations of the marine biota occur in shallow waters, where the available data are typically too sparse to account for the strong spatial and temporal variability. Second, alternative explanations for the observed tracer trends (e.g., changes in the water ventilation rates) cannot be firmly rejected. Our data analysis does not disprove the null-hypothesis of an unchanged biological carbon pump in the North Pacific.

Four simulations, which only differ in the initial state, are forced with 1979-93 European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts reanalysis 1000 hectopascal (hPa) winds and then continued in 1994-97 with ECMWF operational 1000-hPa winds. The model shows differing amounts of Kuroshio penetration across all four simulations for the yearly means, indicating a large degree of nondeterminism at this timescale. This nondeterminism is quantified by a technique that separates the variability of a model variable into deterministic (caused by direct atmospheric forcing) and nondeterministic (caused by mesoscale flow instabilities) components. Analysis indicates substantial nondeterministic sea surface height and upper-layer velocity variability in the vicinity of Luzon Strait. A quantitative measure of Kuroshio intrusion into the SCS is presented that allows interexperiment comparisons and investigation of interannual variability, and attempts are made to positively correlate it with the oceanic and atmospheric environment. Yearly mean Kuroshio intrusion is not strongly linked to Luzon Strait transports or to changes in the North Equatorial Current bifurcation latitude (which is related to the northward Kuroshio transport east of Luzon). Likewise, no relationship could be found that linked interannual variability of yearly mean Kuroshio intrusion or monsoon season mean Luzon Strait transport with the corresponding zonal or meridional wind components, wind stress magnitude, or wind stress curl. However, there was a close relationship between the mean seasonal cycles of the Luzon Strait transport and the northeast-southwest monsoon. Eddy shedding and deep Kuroshio intrusion are rare events during the period of ECMWF reanalysis forcing, but are persistent features during the ECMWF operational time frame. While the wind stress is consistent across the reanalysis/operational time boundary, large differences exist in the wind stress curl pattern over the Luzon Strait and interior of the SCS basin. For contemporaneous years, the ECMWF operational winds produce higher curl extrema (by a factor of 2) and a much sharper north-south gradient in Luzon Strait. The net effect is to produce more Ekman pumping, a deepening of the thermocline, and a more deeply penetrating Kuroshio during the 1994-97 ECMWF operational forcing time frame. Thus, while normal interannual variations of the wind curl did not produce a deterministic response of simulated Kuroshio intrusion, the marked differences in curl between the two atmospheric products did have a substantial impact.\\nC1 USN, Res Lab, Stennis Space Ctr, MS 39529 USA.\\nRP Metzger, EJ (通讯作者)，USN, Res Lab, Code 7323, Stennis Space Ctr, MS 39529 USA.\\nNR 50\\nTC 139\\nZ9 163\\nU1 2\\nU2 36\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA\\nSN 0022-3670\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

The aim of this paper is to present a refraction model in two horizontal dimensions, including moderate amplitude effects, to model these common properties of internal waves. The model incorporates second-order nonlinearity and uses a ray method to allow arbitrary refraction. For these preliminary investigations with the model, a two-layer ocean is assumed with an upper-layer thickness of 50 m and a density difference across the layers of 0.5 kg m(-3). An important aspect affecting the refraction of nonlinear waves is shoaling, as the phase speed of a nonlinear wave depends on its amplitude. In Part I of this paper the development of the model is described, and the shoaling phenomenon is investigated in detail. The shoaling of interfacial internal solitary waves over both slowly varying and rapidly varying bathymetry is studied. A wedge-shaped bathymetry representing an idealized continental slope varying from 1000 to 140 m is considered. Comparisons are made against analytical results for the one-dimensional propagation of solitary waves over varying bathymetry, for both onshelf and offshelf propagation. In the case of onshelf propagation over slowly varying bathymetry, the predictions of the second-order extended Korteweg-de Vries (EKdV) model are that an initial growth in wave amplitude as the wave passes across the deeper part of the slope is compensated by a decay in amplitude as it approaches the shallow water. This effect is particularly pronounced for large amplitude internal waves, and is due to a theoretical limit on EKdV wave amplitude that is explained in detail. In contrast, predictions from a first-order KdV model indicate continuous growth in amplitude, sometimes to unrealistic values. The results agree with adiabatic theory provided the slope of the bathymetry is much weaker than the slope of the interface induced by the internal wave. For very rapid changes in bathymetry the first-order KdV model agrees with predictions of the fission of internal waves found by Djordevic and Redekopp. However, once again the EKdV model gives very different predictions, and in the cases considered no fission was observed, but sometimes a small amplitude dispersive wave train was produced behind the leading wave. Simulations of the offshelf propagation of internal waves suggested that in most cases the adiabatic theory of wave transformation was reversible, but in some cases, when the initial wave amplitude in 140-m depth was close to the theoretical limiting amplitude, the waves were so wide that only extremely weak bathymetric gradients satisfied the slowly varying criterion. These near-limiting waves tended to split as they moved off-shelf. The agreement of the model simulations with analytical results give confidence in applying the model to two horizontal dimensions, which is done in Part II of this paper.\\nC1 Def Evaluat Res Agcy, Winfrith Technol Ctr, Dorchester, England.\\nRP Small, J (通讯作者)，Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, 2525 Correa Rd, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.\\nOI Small, Richard/0000-0002-3452-2179\\nNR 47\\nTC 30\\nZ9 30\\nU1 0\\nU2 8\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA\\nSN 0022-3670\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

The criteria for this scheme were established from spectral characteristics derived from (1) SeaWiFS imagery of a Trichodesmium bloom located in the South Atlantic Bight and (2) modeled remote sensing reflectances of Trichodesmium and other phytoplankton. The classification scheme, which is valid for moderate chlorophyll concentrations of Trichodesmium in coastal waters, is based on the magnitude of the 490-channel reflectance and the spectral shape of remote sensing reflectance at 443, 490 and 555 urn. Analysis suggests that the spatial structure of Trichodesmium populations at sub-pixel scales must be considered when employing spectral characteristics to detect their presence in satellite imagery. This study demonstrates the potential of mapping Trichodesmium from space using spectral observations, even in waters as optically complex as the South Atlantic Bight. Future efforts, which will incorporate ancillary data such as wind speeds and water temperature, will improve the likelihood of correct identification. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The transport mode is dominated by a 100-day peak, while the most coherent energetic meandering signals are found in three limited frequency bands centered near periods of 100 days, 40 days, and 18 days. The detailed structure of the meanders is studied by frequency domain EOF analysis, which also reveals a higher frequency meander centered near 10 days confined to the western side of the channel.\\n   On the 100-day timescale, the Kuroshio transport entering the East China Sea is strongly related to meandering of the Kuroshio, which in turn is caused by westward propagating anticyclonic eddies from the interior ocean. During low transport events, the Kuroshio meanders offshore and partly bypasses the East Taiwan Channel to flow northward along the eastern side of the Ryukyu islands. The interior eddy features that lead to the meandering can be identified as far east as 134 degreesE, propagating westward to the coast of Taiwan at about 10 km day(-1). The 100-day variability that is so dominant in the Kuroshio is virtually absent in the Florida Current but is strongly present east of Bahamas in the Antilles Current and deep western boundary current, presumably being blocked from entering the Straits of Florida by the Bahamas Island chain.\\nC1 Univ Florida, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL USA.\\n   Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei, Taiwan.\\nRP Zhang, DX (通讯作者)，NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.\\nRI Zhang, Dongxiao/A-8381-2009\\nOI Zhang, Dongxiao/0000-0002-0962-7948\\nNR 43\\nTC 143\\nZ9 159\\nU1 3\\nU2 31\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA\\nSN 0022-3670\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

The flood conditions persisted for 1-3 days and were usually accompanied by strong winds from the southern quadrant. The structure of the river plume was strongly influenced by the wind-forcing conditions. During periods of strong southerly (downwelling favorable) winds, the plume was confined inside the 50-m isobath, within about 7 km of shore, with northward velocities of 0.5-1 ms(-1) Occasional northerly (upwelling favorable) winds arrested the northward motion of the plume and caused it to spread across the shelf. Sediment transport by the plume was confined to the inner shelf (water depths less than 50 m), during both southerly and northerly wind conditions. During southerly wind periods, fine, unaggregated sediment was rapidly transported northward to at least 30 km from the river mouth, but flocculated sediment was deposited within 1-10 km of the river mouth. During northerly (upwelling-favorable) winds, most of the sediment fell out within 5 km of the mouth, and negligible sediment was carried offshore, even though the low-salinity plume extended beyond the 60-m isobath. Although sediment deposition from the plume is confined to the inner shelf, the stratigraphy indicates that the principal flood deposits on the adjacent continental shelf occur in a patch between the 60- and 90-m isobath. Thus, the deposition on the inner shelf is ephemeral, and some mechanism other than plume transport delivers the sediment from the inner shelf to the mid-shelf. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

During the observation period, multiple storms and river discharge events occurred, as well as the largest hood on record since 1964. Suspended-sediment concentration at all three sites fluctuated in response to both wave resuspension and advection of river-derived sediments. However, considerable spatial differences in low-frequency currents and suspended-sediment concentration were observed at the three sites. Sediment Aux vectors calculated during periods of high suspended-sediment concentration suggest a convergence of sediment flux coincident with the center of recent flood deposits. Suspended-sediment concentrations observed at the two northern tripod sites following the large flood reached magnitudes typical of fluid mud (> 10 g/l) in a thin near-bed layer. The net sediment flux during the single three-day event was two orders of magnitude larger than any other event during the winter, and accounted for seven times the flux observed over an entire year (1995-1996), A conceptual model for the advection of sediment to the mid shelf is proposed in which river plume sediments are trapped on the inner shelf either due to a weak front or the rapid input of sediment from a confined plume, and form a thin layer of fluid mud. The fluid mud subsequently is transported seaward due to gravitational forcing. The measured sediment concentration and velocity profiles on the shelf provide strong evidence to support this conclusion. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In this study, the causes of this problem are investigated by comparing model solutions to observed NECC estimates. The ocean model is a general circulation model of intermediate complexity. Solutions are forced by climatological and interannual wind stresses, tau = (tau (x), tau (y)), from Florida State University and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Estimates of the observed NECC structure and transport are prepared from expendable bathythermograph data and from the ocean analysis product of NOAA/National Centers for Environmental Prediction.\\n   In solutions forced by climatological winds, the NECC develops a discontinuity in the central Pacific that is not present in the observations. The character of the error suggests that it arises from the near-equatorial (5 degreesS-5 degreesN) zonal wind stress, tau (s),being relatively too strong compared to the y derivative of the wind stress curl term, (curl tau)(y), associated with the intertropical convergence zone. This is confirmed in solutions forced by interannual winds, which exhibit a wide range of responses from being very similar to the observed NECC to being extremely poor, the latter occurring when near-equatorial tau (x) is relatively too strong. Results show further that the model NECC transport is determined mainly by the strength of (curl t) y, but that its structure depends on near-equatorial tau (x); thus, NECC physics involves equatorial as well as Sverdrup dynamics. Only when the two forcing features are properly prescribed do solutions develop a NECC with both realistic spatial structure and transport.\\nC1 Univ Washington, Joint Inst Study Atmosphere & Oceans, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.\\n   Univ Hawaii Manoa, Int Pacific Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.\\n   NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.\\n   Univ Washington, Appl Phys Lab, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.\\nRP Yu, ZJ (通讯作者)，Univ Hawaii, SOEST, IPRC, 2525 Correa Rd, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.\\nNR 22\\nTC 27\\nZ9 29\\nU1 0\\nU2 7\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA\\nSN 0022-3670\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

Apparently generated in the Nuguria island group (3 degreesS, 153 degreesE), the waves propagate northeastward at 2.4-2.8 m s(-1), appearing in fixed phase with the underlying semidiurnal baroclinic tide. The initial solitary wave crests have downward displacements in excess of 60 m and peak velocities greater than 80 cm s(-1). Groups of 1-3 crests are observed, with vertical structure resembling a first-mode internal wave and horizontal variability consistent with third-order comb KdV solitons, Many of the packets exhibit an overall organization reminiscent of undular bores. This borelike behavior is confined primarily to the upper 70 m, not sharing the mode-one dependency of the crests. The solitons displace the ambient equatorial currents, including the Equatorial Undercurrent, both vertically (80 m), and laterally (1-2 km), with little apparent interaction.\\n   A 161-kHz Doppler sonar mounted on the R.V. John Vickers provided ocean velocity measurements with 3-m vertical resolution and 2-min time resolution in the upper 250 m of the sea. Merged with GPS-derived ship\\'s navigation, the resultant depth-time records of absolute velocity enable estimation of how streamlines, given the two-dimensional nature of the wave trains. During passage: of the soliton crests, the vertical displacement of streamlines is in good agreement with the observed vertical displacement of biological scattering layers.\\n   Noticeable increases in acoustic scattering strength are associated with the passage of all soliton groups, suggesting the (turbulent) production of small-scale (0.46 cm) structure in the sound speed field. However, the shear in these mode-one solitons is small compared to ambient equatorial background shears. The minimum Richardson number intrinsic to the soliton packet is of order 15. The crests apparently trigger small-scale instabilities on the background shear. Several of the soliton packets display pronounced internal wave \"tails.\" These too are apparently triggered disturbances on the preexisting flow. High-frequency shears are oriented nearly orthogonal to the low-frequency background, independent of the propagation direction of the soliton.\\n   The energy density of the larger soliton groups approaches 0.2 gigajoules per meter of crest, a value comparable to the underlying baroclinic tide, and also comparable to the energy lost from the M-2 barotropic tide over a similar to 1500 km propagation path through the western tropical Pacific (given a mean barotropic dissipation rate of 3 x 10(-3) W m(-2) for the region).\\nC1 Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Marine Phys Lab, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.\\nRP Pinkel, R (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Marine Phys Lab, 9500 Gilman Dr,Mail Code 0213, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.\\nOI Yang, Yiing-Jang/0000-0002-6637-9311\\nNR 43\\nTC 41\\nZ9 42\\nU1 0\\nU2 7\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA\\nSN 0022-3670\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

While the equatorward flow is in the direction of the persistent, upwelling-favorable wind, the inshore poleward flow is against the wind. The channel circulation also has a strong seasonal signal that the cyclonic circulation strengthens considerably in spring and summer. A three-dimensional model is used to simulate the observed currents over an 8-month period from January to August 1994. The model assimilates the moored temperature and salinity data obtained from a comprehensive circulation study in the SEC-Santa Maria Basin (SME). The model also incorporates surface wind forcing; the mesoscale wind stress pattern is derived from a dense network of weather buoys. The model simulation reproduces well the surface mean currents and their seasonal (monthly) variability. The transient (less than seasonal) model velocity response consists of two fundamental modes, a wind-forced mode and an alongshore pressure gradient-forced mode. The wind-driven circulation is concentrated west of the channel in the SMB. The alongshore pressure gradient-forced motion is concentrated in the channel along the northern coast. Analysis of the evolution of inshore poleward current suggests that the spring transition in this region may coincide with the end of the winter storm season.\\nC1 SUNY Stony Brook, Marine Sci Res Ctr, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.\\nRP Chen, CS (通讯作者)，SUNY Stony Brook, Marine Sci Res Ctr, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.\\nEM dong-ping.wang@sunysb.edu\\nNR 19\\nTC 7\\nZ9 7\\nU1 0\\nU2 0\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

This buoyant intrusion originated from the Hudson estuary more than 100 km upshelf and appeared as a bulge of less saline water with a sharp across-shelf frontal zone at ifs leading edge. During this time, the study area was also forced by a brief upwelling-favorable wind event opposing the direction of buoyant flow propagation.\\n   The interaction of buoyancy and wind forcing generated a spatially variable velocity field. In particular, across-shelf currents were comparable to their alongshelf counterparts. Variability in the alongshelf direction occurred on the scales of the order of the baroclinic Rossby radius. intensive across-shelf currents reached speeds of 20-40 cm s(-1) and appeared as spatially localized mesoscale flows with a width of O(10 km). They were generated at the leading edge of the buoyant intrusion and persisted over the period of observations, slowly propagating southward along with the buoyant flow. They were essentially baroclinic with strong vertical sheer and were further amplified by the wind forcing.\\n   The upwelling-favorable wind event also generated cyclonic circulation within the buoyant intrusion, which has not been observed before. Interaction of the opposing wind and buoyancy forcings deformed the pycnocline into a dome. This dome was effectively isolated from wind-induced turbulent mixing by overlying buoyant water, The adjustment of the velocity field to this density disturbance occurred geostrophically, even though the water depth was only 20-30 m and friction was important. Relative vorticity associated with this cyclonic flow was at least 0.3f.\\nC1 Nova SE Univ, Oceanog Ctr, Dania Beach, FL 33004 USA.\\n   Univ Delaware, Grad Coll Marine Studies, Newark, DE USA.\\nRP Yankovsky, AE (通讯作者)，Nova SE Univ, Oceanog Ctr, 8000 N Ocean Dr, Dania Beach, FL 33004 USA.\\nRI Muenchow, Andreas/J-8257-2012\\nOI Muenchow, Andreas/0000-0001-8360-5686; Yankovsky,\\n   Alexander/0000-0002-0874-9564\\nNR 33\\nTC 34\\nZ9 34\\nU1 0\\nU2 2\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA\\nSN 0022-3670\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

The experiments were conducted under regular wave conditions in a large wave tank where time histories of bottom sheer stress and surface elevation were obtained from a shear plate and wave gauges. Measurements were made at scales approaching those encountered in the field. These data were obtained under steep, vortex ripples where form drag dominated over skin friction for all data presented. Wave friction factors were calculated from measurements and were compared with existing theories as well as with previous laboratory studies. Values of the wave friction factor obtained using the shear plate exhibited reasonable agreement with existing theory. Close agreement between values of the wave friction factor obtained from the shear plate and those measured by previous studies demonstrates that use of a shear plate is a reliable additional method for the measurement of bottom shear stress over a movable bed in the laboratory.\\nC1 Stevens Inst Technol, Dept Civil Environm & Ocean Engn, Davidson Lab, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA.\\nRP Rankin, KL (通讯作者)，Stevens Inst Technol, Dept Civil Environm & Ocean Engn, Davidson Lab, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA.\\nEM krankin@stevens-tech.edu\\nNR 20\\nTC 35\\nZ9 37\\nU1 0\\nU2 5\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

The observations show not only the appearance of a dipole mode in the tropical region but also a persistent basin-scale warming. We present in this study an analysis of the basin-scale sea surface temperature (SST) variations during 1997-1998 using satellite observations, in situ temperature measurements, and National Centers for Environmental Prediction reanalyses. We find that the Indian SST anomaly peaks occurred at two periods, i.e., November-December-January coinciding with the Nino3 peak and the following April-May-June, and were phase locked to the Indian Ocean seasonal cycle. The changes of SST in the equatorial ocean were related to a coupled interaction between the atmosphere and the ocean. Oceanic upwelling in the east and downwelling in the west played a major role in giving rise to the SST anomalies associated with the dipole mode structure. The upwelling off the coast of Sumatra elevated the regional thermocline by more than 80 m in December 1997. On the other hand, the changes of SST in the southern Indian Ocean were largely induced by the changes of local latent flux. During boreal fall-winter of 1997 the southeasterly trades were displaced and abnormally prolonged in their northernmost equatorial position. This shifted the center of the trades toward the equator, weakened the winds in the central Southern Ocean, reduced the latent heat flux in the region, and subsequently induced a surface warming. The total change of the SST anomalies integrated over the two periods, July-December 1997 and January-May 1998, were explained well by the same period latent flux integral in both intensity and pattern. The cross-basin upper ocean temperature sections show that the extratropical warming was rather uniformly distributed in the upper 60 m, further supporting the role of mixed-layer processes in the warming.\\nC1 Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Phys Oceanog, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\n   NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Oceans & Ice Branch, Lab Hydrospher Proc, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.\\nRP Yu, LS (通讯作者)，Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Phys Oceanog, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\nEM lyu@whoi.edu; rienecke@gsfc.nasa.gov\\nNR 40\\nTC 63\\nZ9 71\\nU1 0\\nU2 11\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

Experiments were carried out with a sloping bottom in order to simulate the topographic Perfect. They showed how a vortex can be generated from the current where it separates and reattaches to the cape and that, under some conditions, the eddy is able to detach from the cape and drift westward following isobaths. Two important timescales regulate the how: the time t(f) that the current takes to generate a vortex and the time t(d) that the vortex takes to drift westward for a distance equal to its radius. When these two timescales are either of the same order of magnitude or t(f) < t(d), the eddy was observed to translate westward. For t(f) > t(d) the vortex was able to form at the cape but it did not detach and drift westward. The influence of the depth of the lower layer, h(O), on the flow was investigated The theoretical westward speed tit, depends on the depth of the lower layer. the deeper the lower layer the slower the drift. The values of the slope s required in the experiments in order to obtain the detachment and drift of the vortex indicate that the phenomena will occur on a planetary beta plane only when the variation of the Coriolis parameter with latitude is reinforced by a topographic beta effect. A good agreement between the laboratory experiments and the observations of meddles in the Canary Basin, where the Mediterranean Outflow from the St ait of Gibraltar flows along the coast of Spain and around Cape St. Vincent, suggests that the eddy-shedding process is similar to that observed in the laboratory experiments.\\nC1 Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Phys Oceanog, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\n   Univ Cambridge, Dept Appl Math & Theoret Phys, Cambridge CB3 9EW, England.\\nRP Cenedese, C (通讯作者)，Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Phys Oceanog, MS 21,360 Woods Hole Rd, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\nNR 32\\nTC 29\\nZ9 29\\nU1 0\\nU2 3\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA\\nSN 0022-3670\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

Phytoplankton biomass in the upper 150 m of the water column ranged from 40 to 540 mg chlorophyll a (Chl a) m(-2), exceeding 200 mg Chl a m-2 everywhere except the extreme northern and eastern boundaries of the Ross Sea polynya. Diatom biomass was greatest in the shallow mixed layers of Terra Nova Bay, while the more deeply mixed waters of the Ross Sea polynya were dominated by Phaeocytstis antarctica. Daily production computed from the disappearance of NO3 (1.14 g C m(-2) d(-1)) and total dissolved inorganic carbon (TDIC, 1.29 g C m(-2) d(-1)) is consistent with estimates made from an algorithm forced with satellite measurements of Chl a (1.25 g C m(-2) d(-1)) and from measurements of C-14 uptake (1.33 g C m(-2) d(-1)). Phytoplankton PP in the Ross Sea averaged 100 g C m(-2) yr(-1) during 1996-1997. Despite the early formation of the Terra Nova Bay polynya the diatom bloom there did not reach its peak PP until middle to late January 1997 (most likely because of more intense wind mixing in November), similar to 6 weeks after the P. antarctica bloom in the Ross Sea polynya had reached the same stage of development. From 70 to 100% of the C and N deficits in the upper 150 m could be accounted for by particulate organic matter, indicating that there had been little dissolved organic matter production or export of particulate material prior to our cruise. This suggests that early in the season, PP and zooplankton grazing are decoupled in the southwestern Ross Sea. The NO3:PO4 disappearance ratio in waters dominated by P. antarctica (19.0 +/- 0.61) was significantly greater than in waters where diatoms were most common (9.52 +/- 0.33), and both were significantly different from the Redfield N:P ratio of 16. Vertical profiles of TDIC suggest that P. antarctica took up 110% more CO2 per mole of PO4 removed than did diatoms, an important consideration for climate models that estimate C uptake from the removal of PO4.\\nC1 Stanford Univ, Dept Geophys, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.\\n   Univ Charleston, Grice Marine Lab, Charleston, SC 29412 USA.\\n   Stanford Univ, Sch Earth Sci, Dept Geol & Environm Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.\\n   San Francisco State Univ, Romberg Tiburon Ctr, Tiburon, CA 94920 USA.\\n   NOAA, Natl Environm Satellite Data & Informat Serv, Washington, DC 20233 USA.\\n   Sci Syst & Applicat Inc, Lanham, MD 20706 USA.\\n   Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biol & Microbiol, Oshkosh, WI 54901 USA.\\nRP Arrigo, KR (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Dept Geophys, Mitchell Bldg,Room 360, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.\\nEM arrigo@pangea.stanford.edu; DiTullioJ@cofc.edu;\\n   dunbar@pangea.stanford.edu; dhr@sfsu.edu; mvanwoert@nesdis.noaa.gov;\\n   dlw@weka.gsfc.nasa.gov; lizotte@uwosh.edu\\nOI Dunbar, Robert/0000-0002-9728-5609; Arrigo, Kevin/0000-0002-7364-876X\\nNR 45\\nTC 139\\nZ9 143\\nU1 0\\nU2 28\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

A blended flux data set was developed using a \"reanalysis\" of surface meteorology, from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), turbulent flux components from the COARE bulk flux algorithm, and shortwave radiation and precipitation estimates from satellite remote sensing. Comparison with in situ fluxes from the center of the warm pool showed that the blended fluxes captured variability associated with the intraseasonal oscillation (ISO) while the fluxes produced by ECMWF did not. The influence of surface forcing on SST was assessed by comparing the observed SST tendency to that produced by a one-dimensional model forced by the blended fluxes. On the ISO timescale, SST changes in a substantial portion of the warm pool were found to be dominated by local surface forcing, although significant contributions from other processes (e.g., horizontal advection) were not ruled out. The results emphasize the fact that high-quality surface fluxes are essential to developing accurate predictions of SST variability in the warm pool region.\\nC1 Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Phys Oceanog, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\nRP Zhang, SL (通讯作者)，Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Phys Oceanog, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\nEM aplueddemann@whoi.edu\\nNR 39\\nTC 6\\nZ9 6\\nU1 0\\nU2 1\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

As suggested by McPhee et al. [1998], several times as much heat was emplaced at SHEBA than at Arctic Ice Dynamics Joint Experiment 20 years earlier. A likely mechanism for this would be substantially greater lead opening coupled with the positive feedback loop between increased open water, increased heat absorption, and further ice melting. In addition, a rate of net primary production greater than or equal to 13 gC m(-2) for the preceding spring-summer period was derived using this mixed layer history with an oxygen profile from the fall.\\nC1 Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, MAC, Miami, FL 33149 USA.\\nRP Kadko, D (通讯作者)，Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, MAC, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA.\\nEM dkadko@rsmas.miami.edu\\nNR 16\\nTC 25\\nZ9 28\\nU1 1\\nU2 6\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

A major correction introduces a scaling of Srokosz\\'s model by nonnegligible dimensionless ratios that depend on the slope variance of both long and short waves. With these modifications the EM bias is no longer simply a function of the cross skewness between surface elevation and slope but now depends on the variance ratios that represent the modulation between short and long waves, Inclusion of these ratios can reduce previous EM bias estimates by as much as 50%. Different directions for the longwave and shortwave field are also accounted for in the two-dimensional development of our approach. A radar frequency dependence consistent with observation is also predicted by the new model. Derivation extending our development to the next higher order in wave statistics is also presented and discussed.\\nC1 Johns Hopkins Univ, Appl Phys Lab, Laurel, MD 20723 USA.\\n   IFREMER, Ctr Brest, Dept Oceanog Spatiale, F-29280 Plouzane, France.\\n   NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Lab Hydrospher Proc, Wallops Island, VA 23337 USA.\\nRP Elfouhaily, T (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Univ, Appl Phys Lab, 11100 Johns Hopkins Rd, Laurel, MD 20723 USA.\\nEM Elfouhaily@jhuapl.edu; Donald.Thompson@jhuapl.edu;\\n   Bertrand.Chapron@ifremer.fr; vandemark@gsfc.nasa.gov\\nRI Chapron, Bertrand/O-6527-2015\\nOI Vandemark, Douglas/0000-0003-4367-5457\\nNR 33\\nTC 34\\nZ9 40\\nU1 0\\nU2 0\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

Lead concentrations measured in sediment trap samples vary from 41 +/- 7 ppm in the Ligurian Sea to 58 +/- 10 ppm in the Gulf of Lions. These concentrations, 2-10 times lower than those measured previously in the Gulf of Lions, reflect the reduction of lead fallout from gasoline during the last decade. While atmospheric lead still originates mainly from anthropogenic emissions (automotive and industrial exhausts), stable lead isotopes demonstrate that anthropogenic and lithogenic lead are in similar proportions in the marine particles from the northwestern Mediterranean. Sequential extraction analyses performed on trap samples suggest that the isotopic variations can be explained by a three-component mixing between anthropogenic, natural soluble, and natural refractory sources. In the suspended particulate matter from the Gulf of Lions, lead concentrations range from 0.2 to 30 ng/l, with isotopic compositions comparable to those of the settling particles (Pb-206/Pb-207 from 1.165 to 1.178). This indicates a common origin in these two types of particles, probably mainly controlled by the Rhone River discharge and by resuspension processes on the continental shelf. By contrast, lead concentrations are lower in the suspended matter samples from the Ligurian Sea (0.5 to 1.7 ng/l). In this case, the isotopic signature (1.165 +/- 0.002) is in equilibrium with the dissolved fraction, as previously found in other oligotrophic sites in the open ocean, where the suspended particles are mainly of biological origin and lead essentially authigenic in these particles.

At both stations, maximum coccolith and coccosphere fluxes were recorded during local spring bloom periods. The average coccolith and coccosphere fluxes at NABE-34 were 1.12 x 10(9) m(-2) d(-1) and 4.90 x 10(6) m(-2)d(-1), respectively. At this station coccoliths from 51 taxa were identified. A marked seasonal change was noticed in relative abundances of Emiliania huxleyi and deep photic zone species: E. huxleyi dominated during spring, while in late autumn the coccolith assemblage was dominated by Florisphaera profunda and the coccosphere assemblage by G. flabellatus and Algirosphaera spp., Emiliania huxleyi was the most abundant species in the overall coccolith and coccosphere assemblages with 69% and 64%, respectively. At NABE-48, the average daily fluxes were significantly lower, with 3.88 x 10(8) coccoliths m(-2) d(-1) and 8.45 x 10(5) coccospheres m(-2) d(-1), and only 36 taxa were recorded in the trap samples. Emiliania huxleyi was the dominant species in the coccolith assemblage throughout the year with 72%, and showed maximum fluxes during spring 1990. Coccolithus pelagicus exhibited a distinct seasonal pattern, with maximum fluxes in early June 1989, probably related to the development of a mesoscale cyclonic eddy in the vicinity of the trap site. Holococcolithophore fluxes were highest during maximum sea surface temperatures in summer. The coccosphere assemblage was dominated by Gephyrocapsa spp., Syracosphaera spp., and E. huxleyi. Estimated CaCO3 fluxes of coccoliths, coccospheres, and calcareous dinophytes were compared with the CaCO3 content in the fine(<32 mu m) fraction. The annual mass estimated CaCO3 flux of coccoliths and coccospheres was 5.1 g m(-2) yr(-1) at NABE-34 and 2.7 g m(-2) yr(-1) at NABE-48, and that of calcareous dinophytes 0.9 and 0.1 g m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. These summed mass estimated values contributed on average only 55% at NABE-34 and 60% at NABE-48 to the fine fraction CaCO3. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Although coagulation is known to be important in the process, models used to interpret measurements have been limited to simple descriptions of coagulation. We present results from a coupled adsorption-aggregation model for Th-234 scavenging. The aggregation component models the particle size spectrum from colloidal particles to particles of about 100 mu m in size and incorporates details of the physical mechanisms that bring particles together. We make comparisons between an adsorption model that has a constant mass specific adsorption rate and one that is purely transport limited, the former of which is shown to be unphysical for larger particles. The combined model reproduces the observed inverse dependence of POC/Th-234 On particle size. Comparison with observational results is made by simulating a series of filtrations using the model results. The filtered values are determined by the maximum of the particle distribution within the relevant size range, and consequently affect the comparison between observed values and model output. This stresses the importance of the particle size spectrum in the scavenging process and suggests that measurements using more particle size classes should be made to accurately determine kinetic rates.

Simultaneous measurements were made of seawater temperature and salinity. Real-time AVHRR satellite images of sea surface temperature were processed onshore and transmitted to the ship at sea. Sardine and anchovy eggs were identified and counted live, at sea, and again ashore, preserved. A total of 2129 CUFES samples were collected during 41 d at sea and contained 62,409 sardine and 15,123 anchovy eggs. Sardine eggs were widespread and abundant in both cruises (mean concentrations: 5.2 and 5.1 eggs m(-3)) at and shoreward of the eastern boundary of the California Current. Anchovy eggs were found primarily inshore in the Southern California Eight and were less abundant (0.4 and 1.0 eggs m(-3), respectively, for the two cruises). Temperature-salinity plots indicated distinct separation of the spawning habitat of these two species and consistency in habitat between cruises in successive years. The distributions of sardine eggs and euphausiids collected by CUFES were complementary in space and time. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The cyclonic front of the jet was sharper than 1 km, resulting in a shear several times larger than f. A cross-frontal convergence of 7 cm s(-1) over the width of the front (equivalent to 0.8f) was visible as a 20-m-wide accumulation of debris. The sharpness of the front lasted at least for a day. Away from the cyclonic front, the divergence of the flow was small and the shear was less than 0.6f Thermohaline layers, originating at the front, were interleaving along isopycnals, suggesting water subduction, It is proposed that the asymetry between anticyclonic and cyclonic sides of the jet, and the strong convergence at the cyclonic front, resulted from a frictionally driven ageostrophic secondary circulation superimposed on the geostrophic Row.\\nC1 Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Dept Oceanog, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.\\n   Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.\\nRP Flament, P (通讯作者)，Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Dept Oceanog, 1000 Pope Rd, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.\\nNR 37\\nTC 26\\nZ9 27\\nU1 0\\nU2 7\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA\\nSN 0022-3670\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

We propose that where there is a strong seasonal thermocline: and nutricline, a number of diatoms, hitherto regarded as typical sparse summer flora, characteristic of oligotrophic waters, are able to generate substantial production at depth. These species, including Rhizosolenia spp., Stephanopyxis palmeriana, Thalassiothrix spp. and some Coscinodiscus spp., may represent a \"shade flora\" that have adapted to grow in low-light conditions and/or to regulate their buoyancy to move between a deep nutrient source and the euphotic zone. Although rates of growth and primary production are substantially lower than species characteristic of \"spring bloom\" or \"upwelling\" conditions, the total primary production integrated over the (several-month) period of summer stratification may be as significant as the \"spring bloom\" or greater. The term fall or autumn bloom las a counterpart of the \"spring bloom\") is therefore a misnomer. Whereas the \"spring bloom\" involves a rapid burst of reproduction and sedimentation, the \"fall dump\" is the sedimentation of a long-lived episode of production (lasting the duration of the seasonal thermocline) and triggered by the fall/winter mixing that breaks down stratification. The \"fall dump\" may produce as much, or in some cases more, export production than the \"spring bloom\". The results of this study suggest that a reorientation of thinking on diatom ecology and palaeoecology may be required. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Contrary to previous reports for Monterey Bay, silicate was not found to limit the accumulation of biomass in this diatom-dominated system, although there was evidence that silicate additions can modify the uptake rates of the biomass-limiting substrate (nitrogen). We conclude that silicate is a regulating, but not limiting, nutrient in this study site. Our results are consistent with both the \"shift-up\" and \"detrital\" explanations for changes in specific uptake rates, During upwelling periods (May, September) when the biomass was dominated by phytoplankton, a shift-up type physiological response was observed that was not dependent on the uptake normalization procedure (e,g. chlorophyll versus PN), During the winter months (March, November), characterized by deep mixing, low light, and higher detrital N levels, the apparent shift-up response could be attributed to a change in the PN:Chl ratios and alleviation of light limitation due to the stable light regime provided by the enclosures.

A comparison to excess dissolved and particulate organic carbon showed close agreement between surplus total organic carbon (TOC) and NCP during bloom initiation and productivity maximum; however, when TOC values had returned to low wintertime values NCP was still significantly above zero. This seasonal NCP, 3.9 +/- 1 mol C m(-2), must be equivalent to the particle export to depths greater than 200 m over the whole productive season. We estimate that the annual export was 55 +/- 22% of the seasonal maximum in NCP. The fraction of the seasonal maximum NCP that is exported through 200 m is significantly higher than that measured by moored sediment traps at a depth of 206 m. The removal of carbon, nitrate and phosphate (based on nutrient disappearance since early spring) and their ratios showed significant differences between regions dominated by diatoms and regions dominated by the haptophyte Phaeocystis antarctica. While the DeltaC/DeltaN removal ratio was similar (7.8 +/- 0.2 for diatoms and 7.2 +/- 0.1 for P. antarctica), the DeltaN/DeltaP and DeltaC/DeltaP removal ratios for diatoms (10.1 +/- 0.3 and 80.5 +/- 2.3) were significantly smaller than those of P. antarctica (18.6 +/- 0.4 and 134.0 +/- 4.7). The similarity in DeltaC/DeltaN removal ratios of the two assemblages suggests that preferential uptake of phosphate by diatoms caused the dramatic differences in DeltaC/DeltaP and DeltaN/DeltaP removal ratios. In contrast to low DeltaC/DeltaP and DeltaN/DeltaP removal ratio in diatom-dominated areas early in the growing season, deficit N/P and C/P ratios in late autumn indicate that the elemental stochiometry of exported organic matter did not deviate significantly from traditional Redfield ratios. Changes in biologically utilized nutrient and carbon ratios over the course of the growing season indicated either a substantial remineralization of phosphate or a decrease in phosphate removal relative to carbon and total inorganic nitrogen over the bloom period. The species dependence in C/P ratios, and the relative constancy in. the C/N ratios, makes N a better proxy of biological utilization of CO2. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Differences between P-E parameters, P-max(B) and alpha(B), were observed between filaments and adjacent waters and were associated with differences in phytoplankton community structure. In a southern filament and coastal upwelled waters, the majority of the estimated biomass (chlorophyll a) was present in the larger (2-20 and 20-200 mu m) size fractions; dominant accessory pigments were 19\\'-butanoyloxyfucoxanthin and peridinin, In higher salinity waters, high percentages of chlorophyll a and lutein/zeaxanthin were observed in the smallest size-fraction( < 2 mu m). Whole water values of P-max(B) ranged from 1.77 to 2.31 (g C g chl a(-1) h(-1)) when the majority of the biomass was in the largest fractions. Higher values (more than 4.48 g C g chl a(-1) h(-1)) were determined in whole water samples for communities comprised primarily of small cells. A size dependence was also observed in the value of alpha(B), 0.017 or greater (g C g chl a(-1) h(-1))/(mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1)) for whole water samples at stations dominated by small cells and 0.013 when derived from stations dominated by large cells. The observed pattern of larger phytoplankton associated with upwelling and filament waters was consistent with previous investigations and was, for the most part, comparable to findings in the California Current system. Our results show that differences in taxonomic composition and photosynthetic characteristics were indeed present between filament waters and other distinct regions; these results suggest that taxonomic variations may he associated with size-related variations in P-E parameters. Our findings provide a unique data set describing filament biology in the northern Arabian Sea during the Fall Intermonsoon thus adding important details in efforts to model biogeochemical processes in this region.

Eight cruises sampled the variability of the bay both spatially (within the upwelling plume and offshore) and temporally (during upwelling and non-upwelling seasons, El Nino and non-El Nino years). The larger cell sized (> 5 mu m) autotrophs contributed significantly to chlorophyll, particulate nitrogen, and new and primary productivity in most cruises. This was especially noticeable above a threshold nutrient concentration of 10-12 mu M nitrate. Pooling the entire dataset, there were good linear relationships between biomass and productivity parameters measured using GF/F and 5 mu m filters. The contribution of the > 5 mu m size fraction was greatest at higher biomass concentrations and productivity rates, supporting the idea that to reach maximal values, large cells are required, There were linear trends with Chl:PON ratio of close to 1, and (14)C: (15)NO(3) uptake ratio of about 10 in both total and > 5 mu m size fractions. These large cells are major contributors to carbon and nitrogen productivity in Monterey Bay. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

These radionuclides are derived mainly from discharges from the Sellafield (England, United Kingdom) and La Hague (France) nuclear fuel reprocessing plants and are subsequently transported with Atlantic water into the Arctic Ocean through Fram Strait and the Barents Sea. Iodine 129 results from halocline waters (water depths of 59 and 134 m) collected virtually synoptically throughout the central Arctic Ocean during the USS Cavalla cruise clearly show the front between Atlantic origin water having high I-129 levels (>100 x 10(7) atoms L-1) and Pacific origin water labeled mainly by fallout (<5 x 10(7) atoms L-1). This front is aligned with the Mendeleyev Ridge and is displaced toward the Canada Basin with increasing water depth. Iodine 129 levels decrease on isohaline surfaces from stations over the continental slope and Mendeleyev Ridge to stations in the interior of the Makarov Basin. These results are consistent with circulation mechanisms in which the inferior of the Makarov Basin is ventilated by lateral mixing from topographically steered boundary currents. Low I-129 levels (<2 x 10(7) atoms L-1) measured in Atlantic and intermediate water in the northern Canada Basin and over the Alpha Ridge during the USS Pogy cruise indicate that ventilation rates are extremely low in this region. The much higher I-129 levels (>30 x 10(7) atoms L-1) measured in central regions of the Canada Basin indicate that the interior is more efficiently ventilated than previously thought, possibly by separation from boundary currents flowing over the continental margin north of the Chukchi Plateau. The I-129 and Cs-137 data were interpreted using a transit time model that provided estimates of 6-7 years (+/-0.5 years) for the passage of halocline and Atlantic Water from the Norwegian Coastal Current (60 degrees N) to the continental slope of the Makarov Basin and a lower limit of 8 years for transport to interior regions of the Makarov and Amundsen Basins.\\nC1 Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Bedford Inst Oceanog, Marine Environm Sci Div, Dartmouth, NS B2Y 4A2, Canada.\\n   Oregon State Univ, Coll Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97330 USA.\\nRP Smith, JN (通讯作者)，Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Bedford Inst Oceanog, Marine Environm Sci Div, POB 1006, Dartmouth, NS B2Y 4A2, Canada.\\nEM smithjn@mar.dfo-mpo.gc.ca\\nNR 35\\nTC 65\\nZ9 72\\nU1 0\\nU2 14\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

The first experiment (E1) uses subgrid-scale horizontal diffusion and surface boundary conditions which relax surface temperature and salinity toward observations. The second (E2) replaces the physically incorrect heat and moisture flux boundary conditions of E1 by flux conditions taken from OBAs, plus a term relaxing surface temperatures toward observations. The third (E3) uses the same surface boundary conditions as E2 but replaces the horizontal diffusion by the Gent-McWilliams (GM) parameterization of isopycnal diffusion. Under the restoring surface boundary conditions (E1), the North Atlantic overturning rate is about 17 Sv, smaller than in OBAs, the maximum poleward heat transport in the Northern Hemisphere is 1.2 Petawatts (PW), also smaller than in OBAs, acid in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) region the poleward heat transport is 1.3 PW, much larger than in OBAs. Under the more realistic flux boundary condition (E2) the overturning rate increases to an unrealistically large level of 40 Sv, and the poleward heat transports are only slightly improved. When the GM parameterization is employed (E3), the overturning is reduced to 28 Sv, and the poleward heat transport in the ACC region is reduced to 0.3 PW; both results are consistent with OBAs. However, there is only a slight further improvement in the poleward heat transport in the Northern Hemisphere, which now has a peak value of 1.6 PW, still about 0.5 PW less than in OBAs. The sea surface temperature errors in E3 are consistent with the conclusion that the heat transport in the Northern Hemisphere is still being underestimated. All the experiments show strong systematic biases in the salinity field.\\nC1 MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Program Atmospheres Oceans & Climate, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.\\nRP Jiang, S (通讯作者)，97-24,43rd Ave, New York, NY 11368 USA.\\nEM simonjiang@bloomberg.net; phstone@mit.edu; rizzoli@ocean.mit.edu\\nNR 96\\nTC 44\\nZ9 45\\nU1 0\\nU2 3\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

Oceanic observations between the 2- and 8-m isobaths near Duck, North Carolina, provide a test of the wave setup balance without assuming that wave height in the surfzone is proportional to water depth. Analysis of data from a cross-shore array of 11 pressure gauges and 10 sonar altimeters deployed during the fall of 1994 indicates the wave setup balance holds to at least the accuracy of the pressure measurements (a few centimeters). The correlation between the two terms in the setup balance is 0.93, and the linear regression slope is 1.05 +/- 0.19. Accurate estimates of the cross-shore pressure gradient require density measurements to adjust pressure measurements taken at different depths to the same level. The assumption that pressure and bathymetry are linear between the 2- and 8-m isobaths (or the more common assumption that the height of normally incident, shallow water waves is proportional to the water depth) introduces errors of up to 6 cm for the conditions considered here. Given this assumption, 3.5 years of data from pressure gauges in 2 and 8 m of water indicate that the wave setup balance is valid for a wide range of conditions (correlation 0.71 and regression slope 0.98 +/- 0.08).\\nC1 Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Phys Oceanog, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\nRP Lentz, S (通讯作者)，Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Phys Oceanog, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\nEM slentz@whoi.edu\\nOI Raubenheimer, Britt/0000-0002-3741-4536\\nNR 30\\nTC 32\\nZ9 32\\nU1 0\\nU2 3\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

In recent years many marine benthic habitats in deep water have been described using geophysical and biological data. These descriptions can vary from one investigator to another, which makes it difficult to compare habitats and associated biological assemblages among geographic regions.

Past ray-tracing investigations of the transfer of internal wave energy toward small scales have considered only interactions with background vertical shear V-z = (U-z, V-z). Here, scale analysis and numerical simulations indicate a nonnegligible role for vertical divergence W-z. Background low-frequency vertical shear V-z transfers high-frequency test waves toward small scales while background vertical divergence W-t transfers low frequency test waves toward small scales. These ray-tracing results resemble those of weak resonant-triad interaction theory, although the interactions considered here are not limited to be weak or resonant.\\nC1 Univ Washington, Appl Phys Lab, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.\\n   Univ Washington, Sch Oceanog, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.\\nRP Kunze, E (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Appl Phys Lab, 1013 NE 40th St, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.\\nNR 40\\nTC 21\\nZ9 21\\nU1 0\\nU2 1\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA\\nSN 0022-3670\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

There, an outflow of water from the Tyrrhenian Sea into the Algero Provencal Basin was postulated in the depth range 700-1000 m, to compensate for an observed inflow of deeper water into the Tyrrhenian Sea. However, this outflow, the Tyrrhenian Deep Water (TDW), was undetectable since it would have hydrographic characteristics that could also be produced within the Algero-Provencal Basin. A new data set of hydrographic, tracer, lowered Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (LADCP), and deep float observations presented here allows us now to identify and track the TDW in the Algero-Provencal Basin and to demonstrate the presence and huge extent of this water mass throughout the western Mediterranean. It extends from 600 m to 1600-1900 m depth and thus occupies much of the deep water regime. The outflow from the Tyrrhenian is estimated to be of the order of 0.4 Sv (Sv=10(6) m(3) s(-1)), based on the tracer balances. This transport has the same order of magnitude as the deep water formation rate in the Gulf of Lions. The Tyrrhenian Sea effectively removes convectively generated deep water (Western Mediterranean Deep Water (WMDW)) from the Algero-Provencal Basin, mixes it with Levantine Intermediate water (LIW) above, and reinjects the product into the Algero-Provencal Basin at a level between the WMDW and LIW, thus smoothing the temperature and salinity gradients between these water masses. The tracer characteristics of the TDW and the lowered ADCP and deep float observations document the expected but weak cyclonic circulation and larger flows in a vigorous eddy regime in the basin interior.\\nC1 Baltic Sea Res Inst, D-18119 Rostock, Germany.\\n   Inst Meereskunde, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.\\n   Univ Bremen, Inst Umweltphys, D-38334 Bremen, Germany.\\n   Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA.\\nRP Rhein, M (通讯作者)，Baltic Sea Res Inst, Seestr 15, D-18119 Rostock, Germany.\\nEM monika.rhein@io-warnemuende.de; usend@ifm.uni-kiel.de;\\n   bklein@theo.physik.uni-bremen.de; krahmann@ldeo.columbia.edu\\nRI Rhein, Monika/P-1969-2016\\nOI Rhein, Monika/0000-0003-1496-2828\\nNR 28\\nTC 34\\nZ9 34\\nU1 0\\nU2 7\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

It transports waters from the Arctic and the Nordic Seas into the Atlantic and also acts as a western-intensified southward return flow for waters recirculating within the Greenland Sea Gyre, itself an area important for deep water formation. Data from current meters moored across the current at 75 degrees N in 1994-1995 show a large seasonal variation in the current. The annual mean transport is 21 +/- 3 Sv (taking 9 degrees W as the eastern boundary), varying from 11 Sv in summer to 37 Sv in winter (errors approximately +/- 5 Sv). No significant seasonal signal has been observed in the Fram or Denmark Straits, suggesting that the seasonal transport is confined within the Greenland Sea. Using temperature and velocity data, we split the flow at 75 degrees N into two parts, a mainly wind-driven circulation (annual mean of order 19 Sv), which is trapped within the Greenland Sea Gyre and exhibits a large seasonal cycle, transporting, predominantly, the waters of the Greenland Sea, and a steadier throughflow probably thermohaline-driven (of order 8 Sv in the annual mean), with very little seasonal variation. Data from previous years, 1987-1994, indicate the interannual variability of the current is low. Assuming a spatially coherent structure to the current, we extend the time series of the transport back to 1991, and suggest it may be possible to monitor the total transport with one suitably placed mooring.\\nC1 Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Meeresforsch, D-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany.\\nRP Woodgate, RA (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Polar Sci Ctr, Appl Phys Lab, 1013 NE 40th St, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.\\nEM woodgate@apl.washington.edu\\nNR 29\\nTC 81\\nZ9 82\\nU1 0\\nU2 6\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

The model dynamics is quasigeostrophic, the density stratification is represented in 1.5- and 2-layer approximations, and the wind stress pattern is either asymmetric or symmetric about the midbasin. The authors show that more generic variability arises when the forcing is strongly asymmetric, the Reynolds number is relatively large, and the baroclinic instability mechanism is active. The variability is explored for a wide range of values for the viscosity coefficient, that is, the Reynolds number. The regimes include steady circulation, periodic and quasiperiodic fluctuations near the beginning of the bifurcation tree, and chaotic circulations characterized by a broadband spectrum. Both the primary and secondary bifurcation modes and the spatiotemporal patterns within certain frequency bands in the chaotic regime are analyzed with an EOF decomposition combined with the time filtering.\\n   In the symmetric case the 1.5-layer flow develops anomalously low-frequency fluctuations with a very non-Gaussian distribution. The baroclinic instability that arises in a 2-layer flow tends to weaken and regularize somewhat the low-frequency variability, but it still has the character of infrequent transitions between distinct pyre patterns. The variability of the circulation forced by asymmetric wind differs substantially from the symmetric forcing case. In 2-layer solutions the power at low frequencies progressively increases with the Reynolds number. The dominant low-frequency variability is associated with changes in the position and shape of the eastward jet and its associated western-basin recirculation zone. This variability occurs smoothly in time, albeit irregularly with a broadband spectrum.\\nC1 Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Geophys & Planetary Phys, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.\\nRP Berloff, PS (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Geophys & Planetary Phys, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.\\nEM pavel@atmos.ucla.edu\\nRI Berloff, Pavel/T-2851-2019\\nNR 35\\nTC 81\\nZ9 81\\nU1 1\\nU2 10\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA\\nSN 0022-3670\\nEI 1520-0485\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

A tongue of high salinity water extends along the isopycnal sigma(1) = 24.5 from its surface outcrop in the southeast Pacific to 175-m depth near 5 degrees-10 degrees S along the section at 165 degrees E. In the west, the tongue moves vertically with the thermocline, mostly as part of the ENSO cycle, while salinity in the tongue varied interannually over a range of 0.4 psu. Most of this variability was due to zonal advection along the isopycnal tongue, with similar changes observed at other longitudes in the west and central Pacific. Part of the interannual salinity signal can be attributed to changes in the near-zonal flow of the South Equatorial Current associated with El Nino, but a general 0.3 psu rise occurring during the 1990s (probably starting even earlier) was not apparently consistent with this explanation. An attempt was made to trace the source of these changes to surface fluxes at the outcrop, where the variation of evaporation and precipitation suggested salinity anomalies of the same magnitude as the subsurface changes. However, the implied surface salinity changes were of the wrong sign to explain the subsequent downstream subsurface variability, and therefore present observations do not demonstrate any influence of subduction of surface properties on salinity in the southern high salinity tongue.\\nC1 NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.\\nRP Kessler, WS (通讯作者)，NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, 7600 Sand Point Way Ne, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.\\nNR 35\\nTC 67\\nZ9 67\\nU1 0\\nU2 9\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA\\nSN 0022-3670\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

The goal in the creation of these data was to produce a long-term, consistent set of sea ice extents and areas that provides the means for reliably determining sea ice variability over the 18.2-year period and also serves as a baseline for future measurements. We describe the method used to match the sea ice extents and areas from these four multichannel sensors and summarize the problems encountered when working with radiances from sensors having different frequencies, different footprint sizes, different visit times, and different calibrations. A major obstacle to adjusting for these differences is the lack of a complete year of overlapping data from sequential sensors. Nonetheless, our procedure reduced ice extent differences during periods of sensor overlap to less than 0.05% and ice area differences to 0.6% or less.\\nC1 NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Lab Hydrospher Proc, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.\\nRP Cavalieri, DJ (通讯作者)，NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Lab Hydrospher Proc, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.\\nEM don@cavalieri.gsfc.nasa.gov\\nRI Parkinson, Claire L/E-1747-2012\\nOI Parkinson, Claire L/0000-0001-6730-4197\\nNR 22\\nTC 253\\nZ9 263\\nU1 0\\nU2 28\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

The forcing fields are provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts reanalysis project. The OGCM is a coarse horizontal resolution model (2 degrees longitude by 1.5 degrees latitude with 31 levels in the vertical), mainly used for climate studies. Horizontal mixing is done along isopycnal surfaces, whereas the parameterization of vertical mixing is based on a local estimate of the turbulent kinetic energy. The comparison is quantitative in the sense that TOPEX/POSEIDON observations are interpolated onto the model grid by an objective interpolation in view of the assimilation case. The model simulation is compared to the observations at large spatial scales of 500 km or more. The basic features of the variability are simulated well by the model, in particular with respect to the annual cycle. Major discrepancies are found in the vicinity of western boundary currents and in the Southern Ocean, due in part to the inadequate horizontal resolution. In anticipation of a future assimilation of the observed sea level a decomposition of the model sea level into baroclinic/barotropic components diagnosed with some dynamical variables of the model is then examined. It is shown that the baroclinic component explains the large seasonal variations confined in the upper layers, whereas the barotropic component is associated with intraseasonal variability. The results of the present study confirm that the model sea level is consistent with the observed large-scale variability, providing a basis for future assimilation of the data into the OGCM to improve the representation of the ocean state.\\nC1 CNRS, OMP, LEGOS, Lab Etud Geophys & Oceanog, F-31401 Toulouse, France.\\nRP Maes, C (通讯作者)，NCEP, EMC, CMB, Room 807,5200 Auth Rd, Camp Springs, MD 20746 USA.\\nEM cmaes@sun1.wwb.noaa.gov; pierre.de-mey@cnes.fr\\nRI maes, christophe/L-4049-2015\\nOI maes, christophe/0000-0001-6532-7141\\nNR 29\\nTC 12\\nZ9 15\\nU1 0\\nU2 0\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

In order to investigate the role of eddy-flux divergences in the density equation, the GFDL Modular Ocean Model (MOM) has been configured as a simple flat-bottomed channel model with sufficient resolution to represent mesoscale eddies. Eady-type baroclinic instability and a wind-forced channel have been considered. As an analog to the large-scale components addressed by low-resolution models, the influence of eddy fluxes on the zonal-mean density held was evaluated. Results show that eddy-flux divergences are larger than mean-flux divergences. The effect of mesoscale eddies on the mean density field is often hypothesized to take an advective form that conserves mean density so that eddy effects are adiabatic in the zonal mean. However. in both of the examples studied a significant component of the mesoscale eddy effect on the zonal mean is diabatic and makes mean density nonconservative. The associated diapycnal fluxes result from zonally averaging terms representing processes that are locally adiabatic.\\n   Subgrid-scale parameterizations (such as eddy diffusion) represent the unresolved eddy-flux divergence as a function of the resolved density field. The authors computed optimal coefficients for a variety of parameterizations and evaluated their skill. When the model output is time-averaged, quasi-adiabatic parameterizations, such as the one proposed by Gent and McWilliams, are able to explain as much as 43% of the mean-squared eddy-flux divergence. However, for shorter averaging periods or instantaneous snapshots, even for the spatially averaged model fields, parameterization skill drops.\\nC1 Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Phys Oceanog Res Div, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.\\nRP Gille, ST (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.\\nEM sgille@uci.edu\\nRI Gille, Sarah T./B-3171-2012\\nOI Davis, Russ/0000-0003-1903-6313; Gille, Sarah/0000-0001-9144-4368\\nNR 35\\nTC 28\\nZ9 28\\nU1 0\\nU2 2\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA\\nSN 0022-3670\\nEI 1520-0485\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

Winter time suspended particulate matter concentration was more than 10-100 mg l(-1) in the coastal domain and less than 10 mg l(-1) in the central domain. Concentrations of dissolved Pb-210 over the area were low ( < 5 dpm kg(-1)) due to the efficient removal of Pb-210 from the water column over the shelf. Evidence for release of Po-210 is seen in a sub-surface layer, close to the sediment-water interface, where Po-210 is enriched in the dissolved form and depleted in the particles. The high concentration of SPM in the mouth of the Yellow Sea appears to determine dissolved and particulate Pb-210 and Po-210 activities. The atmospheric input of Pb-210 is the major source of Pb-210 in the region with minor contribution from the Pb-210 rich Kuroshio Water. The K-d values of Po-210 varied by a factor of 50 while the corresponding values of Pb-210 varied only by a factor of 4. It appears that in waters where particle concentrations are high ( > 10 mg l(-1)), the K-d appears to be independent of particle concentration. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Over the ocean, backscatter measurements are used to infer surface wind vectors. Wind retrieval is based on a statistical relationship between short-ocean wave roughness (that causes the backscatter) and the surface wind speed and direction. For NSCAT geometry, multiple antennas are used to provide backscatter measurements at several azimuth directions to resolve wind direction ambiguities. To achieve the desired wind vector accuracy, these antenna beams must be calibrated within a few tenths of a decibel. A simple relative-calibration method is applied to the NASA scatterometer backscatter from homogenous, isotropic, large-area targets. These targets exhibit both azimuth and time invariant radar response. A simple polynomial model for incidence angle dependence of sigma(o) is used, and the mean radar response from all antenna beams is taken as the reference. Corrections (sigma(o) biases) are calculated as differences tin log space) between measurements from particular beam and the reference. This simple model is applied to data from the Amazon rain forest and the Siberian plain. These areas are tested for temporal stability within the calibration period (several weeks). High-resolution masks are applied to extract suitable calibration data sets. Calculated corrections for each antenna beam are added to NSCAT sigma(o) measurements as a function of incidence angle. The magnitudes of corrections show the necessity of on-orbit calibration.\\nC1 Univ Cent Florida, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Cent Florida Remote Sensing Lab, Orlando, FL 32816 USA.\\n   Brigham Young Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Provo, UT 84601 USA.\\nRP Zec, J (通讯作者)，Univ Cent Florida, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Cent Florida Remote Sensing Lab, Orlando, FL 32816 USA.\\nEM josko@bruce.engr.ucf.edu; ljones@pegasus.cc.ucf.edu\\nRI Zec, Josko/G-6925-2016; Jones, W Linwood/AAX-9573-2020; Long, David\\n   G./K-4908-2015\\nOI Zec, Josko/0000-0003-1649-1222; Long, David G./0000-0002-1852-3972;\\n   Jones, W Linwood/0000-0001-8796-4598\\nNR 7\\nTC 11\\nZ9 13\\nU1 0\\nU2 2\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

Recent investigations have already shown a possible coupling of large structures in atmospheric turbulence and surface ripples. This was done using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery of ocean surface and almost simultaneous advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) imagery of cloud streets at a cold-air outbreak. The intent of our study is to further validate this hypothesis in a general case of coastal circulation. For this purpose we analyze a suite of collocated simultaneous records of airflow, radar return, and surface elevations from a coastal platform. We investigate the influence of large eddies (20-60 min) on the turbulent properties of the airflow in the first 2 m above the ocean surface. The analysis shows very prominent peaks in the magnitude of 12- to 16-min fluctuations which are further modulated in 20- to 40-min intervals. These scales and modulations are characteristic for all variables of interest here. The detected scales and their modulation suggest significant interaction of surface layer within the first 1-2 m with large eddies of scales of O(1) and O(10) km. The intermittent structure of turbulence responds by alternating contributions from bursts and sweeps; the frequency of occurrence of bursts and sweeps also reveals the influence of large structures. The instantaneous cross correlation between the shorter scales of momentum flux and radar return, corresponding to the individual burst events, can be 4 times as strong as the overall cross correlation.\\nC1 Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, Miami, FL 33149 USA.\\nRP Savtchenko, A (通讯作者)，Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA.\\nEM asavtchenko@rsmas.miami.edu\\nNR 17\\nTC 4\\nZ9 4\\nU1 0\\nU2 1\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

Thermohaline observations within the Indonesian seas in August 1993 (southeast monsoon) and February 1994 (northwest monsoon) offer an opportunity to compare observations to model output for these periods. The simulation used in these comparisons is the Los Alamos Parallel Ocean Program (POP) 1/6 drg ton average) global model, forced by ECMWF wind stresses for the period 1985 through 1995. The model temperature structure shows discrepancies from the observed profiles, such as between 200 and 1200 dbar where the model temperature is as much as 3 degrees C warmer than the observed temperature. Within the 5 degrees-28 degrees C temperature interval, the model salinity is excessive, often by more than 0.2. The model density, dominated by the temperature profile. is lower than the observed density between 200 and 1200 dbar, and is denser at other depths. In the model Makassar Strait, North Pacific waters are found dawn to about 250 dbar, in agreement with observations. The model sill depth in the Makassar Strait of 200 m, rather than the observed 550-m sill depth, shields the model Flares Sea from Makassar Strait lower thermocline water, causing the Flores lower thermocline to be dominated by salty water from the Banda Sea. In the Maluku, Scram, and Banda Seas the model thermocline is far too salty, due to excessive amounts of South Pacific water. Observations show that the bulk of the Makassar throughflow turns eastward into the Flores and Banda Seas, before exiting the Indonesian seas near Timer. In the model, South Pacific thermocline water spreads uninhibited into the Banda, Flores, and Timer Seas and ultimately into the Indian Ocean. The model throughflow transport is about 7.0 Sv (Sv = 10(6) m(3) s(-1)) in August 1993 and 0.6 Sv in February 1994, which is low compared to observationally based estimates. However. during the prolonged EI Nino of the early 1990s the throughflow is suspected to be lower than average and, indeed, the model transports for the non-El Nino months of August 1988 and February 1989 are larger It is likely that aspects of the model bathymetry, particularly that of the Torres Strait, which is too open to the South Pacific, and the Makassar Strait, which is too restrictive, may be the cause of the discrepancies between observations and model.\\nC1 Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA.\\n   USN, Postgrad Sch, Dept Oceanog, Monterey, CA 93943 USA.\\nRP Gordon, AL (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA.\\nRI Gordon, Arnold L/H-1049-2011\\nOI Gordon, Arnold L/0000-0001-6480-6095\\nNR 59\\nTC 55\\nZ9 59\\nU1 0\\nU2 11\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA\\nSN 0022-3670\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

The particles were separated from particulate organic carbon (POC) with a flow cytometer, volume-scattering functions were measured with a laser light-scattering photometer, and particle composition was measured using atomic absorption spectrometry. Small calcite coccoliths were best sorted by gating on the ratio of horizontally polarized forward light scattering and vertically polarized forward light scattering;plated coccolithophores could be sorted by gating on side scattering and forward angle light scattering. Normalized volume-scattering functions for the culture-derived calcite particles varied by a factor of 2 for the different species. Backscattering cross sections (m(2) particle(-1)) for calcite particles varied by similar to 35 times and were generally a function of size. Backscattering efficiencies were similar to 2-4 times higher for cells with CaCO3 than without it. CaCO3-specific backscattering showed much less variability across various species; the calcite-specific backscattering coefficient varied by only similar to 38% for both cultured coccolithophores and field-derived CaCO3 particles. Organic carbon-specific backscattering of \"naked\" coccolithophores was highly consistent within all coccolithophores used in our experiments, as well as with values in the literature. Our results suggest that both POC and PIC can be optically estimated, the former by measuring backscattering of decalcified phytoplankton as well as their size distribution, and the latter is proportional to acid-labile backscattering. These results show the feasibility of a rapid optical technique for measuring two biogeochemically important carbon fractions in the sea.\\nC1 Bigelow Lab Ocean Sci, W Boothbay Harbor, ME 04575 USA.\\n   Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA.\\n   Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Div Meteorol & Phys Oceanog, Miami, FL 33149 USA.\\nRP Balch, WM (通讯作者)，Bigelow Lab Ocean Sci, W Boothbay Harbor, ME 04575 USA.\\nOI Vaillancourt, Robert/0000-0003-1008-2380\\nNR 63\\nTC 62\\nZ9 63\\nU1 1\\nU2 20\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

The temperature, salinity and chlorophyll time series are used as constraints on a simple box model to extrapolate total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), total alkalinity (TA) and oceanic CO2 fugacity (fCO(2)) over the five years of the monitoring. Results of the simulation are compared to all available observations.\\n   Both measured and simulated DIC and TA give seasonal signals of 25 mu mol/kg and 8 mu eq/kg, respectively. In spite of a weak primary production about 70 gC/m(2)/yr, the biological pump appears to play a significant role on seasonal and interannual variations in air-sea CO2 exchanges. Its contribution varies from 10 to 45% of the total sea surface fCO(2) variations depending on the period. This area has been a sink for atmospheric CO2 with annual mean values of -0.8 to -3.0 mol/m(2)/yr during the whole period investigated. Annually the CO2 sink is due to the balance between biological activity and mixing processes on fCO(2) inducing thermodynamically mediated variations. The sink\\'s interannual variations appear to be mainly due to the high variability of the wind speeds and hence, of the mixed-layer depth.\\n   The impact of the anthropogenic atmospheric CO2 increase on oceanic fCO(2) is also investigated. The rate of increase of oceanic fCO(2) (0.6 mu atm/yr) was half that of atmospheric fCO(2) (1.2 mu atm/yr). The increase of the air-sea CO2 gradient lead to an increase of the CO2 sink of about 0.07 mol/m2/yr (0.02 GtC/yr) over the five years investigated.\\nC1 Univ Paris 06, Phys & Chim Marines Lab, CNRS, F-75252 Paris 05, France.\\nRP Louanchi, F (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Dept Meteorol, 503 Walker Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.\\nEM ferial@essc.psu.edu\\nNR 52\\nTC 16\\nZ9 18\\nU1 0\\nU2 1\\nPU SEARS FOUNDATION MARINE RESEARCH\\nPI NEW HAVEN\\nPA YALE UNIV, KLINE GEOLOGY LAB, 210 WHITNEY AVENUE, NEW HAVEN, CT\\n   06520-8109 USA\\nSN 0022-2402\\nEI 1543-9542\\nJ9 J MAR RES\\nJI J.

Methodology\\nSO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS\\nLA English\\nDT Article\\nID EQUATORIAL PACIFIC; SURFACE CURRENTS; VARIABILITY; TURBULENCE;\\n   CIRCULATION; DISPERSION; DRIFTERS; VELOCITY; FIELDS\\nAB The tropical Pacific Ocean surface current system can be characterized by a strong degree of nonstationarity due to the fast response time of equatorial and near-equatorial dynamics. The ocean-atmospheric dynamics create longitudinally coherent zonal flow (zonal length scales l(x) similar to 60 degrees) with strong meridional shear (l(y) similar to 1 degrees in latitude) in the large-scale mean and an energetic mesoscale (O(100 km)) component. Parameterization of the effects of the mesoscale field depends on the separation of the large-scale mean from the observed velocity. In this paper the focus is placed on the key issue: separating the flow into large-scale mean and mesoscale eddy components in order to compute meaningful eddy diffusivity estimates in flow regimes that demonstrate strong currents and strong shear. Large gradients in the large-scale mean have precluded diffusivity estimation by traditional binning techniques. In this first of two publications, a method is developed for using Lagrangian data to estimate the diffusivity addressing the inhomogeneity of the mean flow. The spatially dependent estimate of the mean field is computed with a least squares bicubic smoothing spline interpolation scheme with an optimized roughness parameter which guarantees minimum energy in the fluctuation field at low frequencies. Numerical simulations based on a stochastic model of a turbulent shear flow are used to validate our approach in a conceptually simple but realistic scenario. The technique is applied to near-surface drifter observations obtained from 1979-1946 from two dynamically distinct time-space regions of the tropical Pacific Ocean. The first region, in the South Equatorial Current, is characterized by a linear zonal shear mean flow and an approximately exponential autocovariance structure in the residuals. The velocity residuals have velocity variance of (s) over cap(2) = 130 cm(2) s(-2) for both components, and horizontal diffusivities are <(kappa)over cap>(u) approximate to 7 X 10(7) cm(2) s(-1) and <(kappa)over cap>(v) approximate to 3 X 10(7) cm(2) s(-1). No significant interannual variations of the estimates are detected, but residual trends in the estimators arise from intraseasonal variations in the velocity field during the 3-month season. The second region, in the North Equatorial Countercurrent and the North Equatorial Current, has a mean flow with a strong zonal shear and a weak northward velocity. The autocovariance is approximately exponential for the zonal component, while the meridional component has a negative lobe at about 10 days, probably due to the presence of instability waves. The variance is 380 cm(2) s(-2) for the zonal component and 360 cm(2) s(-2) for the meridional component, while the horizontal diffusivities are <(kappa)over cap>(u) approximate to 15 X 10(7) cm(2) s(-1) and <(kappa)over cap>(v) approximate to 4 X 10(7) cm(2) s(-1). Strong intraseasonal variability requires a maximum time window of 2 months for approximate stationarity to hold for the covariance calculations.\\nC1 Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USA.\\n   CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.\\n   NOAA, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Miami, FL 33149 USA.\\nRP Bauer, S (通讯作者)，Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA.\\nEM swenson@aoml.erl.gov\\nNR 30\\nTC 87\\nZ9 87\\nU1 0\\nU2 13\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

Analyses of the Aleutian low from monthly mean northern hemisphere sea level pressure for winters (December-March) for 1947-1996 are presented and compared with monthly mean ice cover from the Bering Sea for 1952-1996, the Southern Oscillation Index, and the western Pacific oscillation. Before the regime shift, below normal ice cover in the Bering Sea was typically associated with El Ni (n) over tilde o conditions, which caused the Aleutian low to move eastward of normal, carrying warm Pacific air over the Bering Sea. Conversely, above normal ice cover was associated with La Ni (n) over tilde a conditions, which caused the Aleutian low to move westward of normal, allowing higher pressure to move over the Bering Sea. Since the regime shift, during El Ni (n) over tilde os the Aleutian low has been moving even farther east, causing winds to blow from the east and north off Alaska and resulting in above normal ice in the Bering Sea. Before the regime shift the occurrence of El Ni (n) over tilde o and La Ni (n) over tilde a conditions was about even. Since the regime shift, El Ni (n) over tilde o conditions are about 3 times more prevalent. In recent work [e.g., Mantua et al., 1997; Minobe, 1997] there is evidence that this regime shift is the latest in a series of climate shifts going back to at least the late 1800s and may be due to a 50- to 70-year oscillation in a North Pacific atmospheric-ocean coupled system.\\nC1 Univ Alaska, Inst Marine Sci, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.\\nRP Niebauer, HJ (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA.\\nNR 32\\nTC 99\\nZ9 105\\nU1 4\\nU2 16\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

When sorted into distance classes from the ice edge, snow and ice thicknesses show a pattern of spatial and temporal variability that reflects the relative regional importance of different sea ice growth mechanisms, motion and deformation as well as of oceanographic processes. The potential for snow ice formation was directly investigated for the drilling data. Flooding, measured prior to drilling, has a strong correspondence with negative freeboard while moist snow shows a lesser correspondence. Wetness and flooding are strongly correlated with the ratio of snow load and ice thickness while the relation to the amount of ridging is less conclusive. Using an isostatic argument, the contribution of snow ice formation to the overall ice growth was shown to be considerably higher than that of congelation ice growth. It was found that one length unit of snow accumulation or bottom ice melt on an ice flee leads to approximately the same amount of subsidence for the flee. Further, rates of subsidence, due to snow load and ice melt, appear to be similar to uplift from congelation ice growth. The degree of isostatic balance on different spatial scales was evaluated by introducing a generalized density-weighted snow/ice thickness ratio (GSI) for the drilling data. The GSI includes slush densities in order to account for the suggested importance of snow ice formation. Deviations from isostatic balance occur locally but decrease quickly on spatial averaging scales of a few meters. The closest fit to isostatic equilibrium is reached by choosing a maximum value for the slush density.\\nC1 Univ Alaska, Inst Geophys, Fairbanks, AK USA.\\nRP Adolphs, U (通讯作者)，Weissenburger Pl 6B, D-81667 Munich, Germany.\\nEM uadolphs@t-online.de\\nNR 47\\nTC 22\\nZ9 22\\nU1 1\\nU2 6\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

A perturbation and multiple scales analysis is utilized and is carried out to the third order. Recent parallel efforts for a two-layer model have shown that surface waves can resonate, exponentially in time, two oblique internal wave trains whose frequencies are nearly subharmonic to that of the surface wave. This analysis is generalized in the current paper to allow for continuous variation of density with depth, as well as planetary rotation. Specific attention is focused on the energy transfer from the semidiurnal barotropic tide to near-inertial baroclinic motion. At low latitudes, linear analysis demonstrates that such a resonant triad indeed exists, suggesting that this mechanism may play a role in the development of the inertial peak seen in many internal wave spectra. At the second order, evolution equations are obtained that demonstrate that the internal waves initially grow exponentially in time. Finally, when the analysis is carried to the third order, it is shown that an equilibrium exists. Nonlinear detuning of the internal wave frequencies results in the internal wave amplitudes reaching a steady-state value, which is readily calculated.\\nC1 Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Civil Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.\\nRP Hill, DF (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 412 OBrien Hall 1712, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.\\nRI Hill, David/C-4569-2012\\nNR 22\\nTC 0\\nZ9 0\\nU1 0\\nU2 2\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA\\nSN 0022-3670\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

These characteristics vary spatially and temporally, and it is important in the development of constitutive models to address their variability in physically meaningful terms. A program of laboratory experiments on field cores of first-year sea ice has been conducted to aid in the development of such models. A thorough assessment of the bulk physical properties and microstructural characteristics of the ice has been carried out in conjunction with a detailed set of cyclic loading and creep experiments. Methodology was developed to calculate an orientation factor that determines the average shear stress resolved on the basal planes, given the background normal stress. Examination of the constitutive behavior using laboratory cyclic loading and constant load creep experiments revealed that the elastic, anelastic (time-dependent recoverable), and viscous strains varied systematically with the orientation factor. The observations also indicate significant brine porosity effects on the elastic, anelastic, and viscous components of strain. A recently developed constitutive model was expanded to include a frequency- and orientation-dependent viscous straining term, and the model predictions agreed well with the experimental observation.\\nC1 USA, Cold Reg Res & Engn Lab, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.\\n   Wesleyan Univ, Coll Letters, Middletown, CT 06459 USA.\\nRP Cole, DM (通讯作者)，USA, Cold Reg Res & Engn Lab, 72 Lyme Rd, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.\\nNR 30\\nTC 23\\nZ9 24\\nU1 0\\nU2 5\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

The model is forced with a steady, sinusoidal wind stress. The effects of the wind stress, coupled with instabilities, create an unsteady, zonal surface jet at the boundary between the model subtropical and subpolar gyres. The bottom layer includes a DWBC created by specifying a mass inflow at the northern boundary and a mass outflow at the southern boundary. A numerical tracer is introduced into the DWBC with the mass source at the northern boundary.\\n   The surface jet creates an effective boundary to tracer transport in the DWBC. This barrier to meridional tracer transport causes approximately 70% of the tracer moved our of the northern parr of the DWBC to be transported zonally into the interior with only 30% continuing southward in the DWBC. In model runs with a flat bottom, approximately 20% of the total meridional tracer flux is due to the eddy field. When the model is run with sloping topography along the western boundary, only 2% of the meridional tracer flux is due to the eddy field. The dependence of zonal tracer flux on eddies is highly latitude dependent, and in the region of interest (far from the northern boundary) the mean field is responsible for most of the zonal tracer flux.\\n   Eddies play a role in tracer flux in two ways: 1) the direct influence of the eddies in transporting tracer and 2) the effect of the eddies in driving the mean flow. A comparison between eddy-resolving runs and those with eddy diffusivity to parameterize the eddies suggests that the role of the eddy field in driving the mean how field is of primary importance.\\nC1 Univ Washington, Sch Oceanog, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.\\nRP Ladd, C (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Sch Oceanog, Box 357940, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.\\nEM cladd@ocean.washington.edu\\nRI Ladd, Carol/M-6159-2014; Thompson, LuAnne/AAA-1000-2020\\nOI Ladd, Carol/0000-0003-1065-430X; Thompson, LuAnne/0000-0001-8295-0533\\nNR 32\\nTC 3\\nZ9 3\\nU1 0\\nU2 3\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA\\nSN 0022-3670\\nEI 1520-0485\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

A vertically integrated numerical model is used to study the influence of Neptune effect upon the tide- and wind-induced residual circulation of the Gulf of California, The model is forced at the mouth of the gulf by the tides and at the sea surface by the wind. It is found that the parameterization induces mean currents in areas where the residuals produced by tides and winds are small. Tide- and wind-induced residuals are large along the mainland coast and from the archipelago to the north, where the Neptune effect parameterization is less important.

The distribution of the water mass tracer PO4* (\"phosphate star\") in the deep sea suggests that the amount of ventilated deep water produced in the Southern Ocean is equal to or greater than the outflow of North Atlantic Deep Water from the Atlantic. Radiocarbon distributions yield an export flux of water from the North Atlantic which has averaged about 15 Sv over the last several hundred years. CFC inventories are used as a direct indicator of the current production rate of ventilated deep water in the Southern Ocean. Although coverage is as yet sparse, it appears that the CFC inventory is not inconsistent with the deep water production rate required by the distributions of PO4* and radiocarbon. It has been widely accepted that the major part of the deep water production in the Southern Ocean takes place in the Weddell Sea. However, our estimate of the Southern Ocean ventilated deep water flux is in conflict with previous estimates of the flux of ventilated deep water from the Weddell Sea, which lie in the range 1-5 Sv.

Both nuclides exhibit their characteristic distributions. In the surface water, the exponential-like decrease of Ra-228 away from Baja California can be interpreted by horizontal water mixing with eddy diffusion coefficients (K-x) of 1 x 10(6) cm(2) s(-1) and 5 x 10(7) cm(2) s(-1) for scale lengths of 200 km and 1000 km, respectively. In the bottom waters, the decrease of Ra-228 away from bottom sediments can be modeled by vertical eddy diffusivities (K-z) of 15-30 cm(2) s(-1) except at one station (24 degrees 16.9\\' N, 115 degrees 8.9\\' W) where a value of 120 cm(2) s(-1) is obtained. The Ra-228-derived diffusivities were used to compute the mass balance of 226Ra using a two-box model. The model results show a mean mixing coefficient of 3.8 cm(2) s(-1) for the thermocline and a mean upwelling velocity of 7.7 m y(-1) in the study area, both are about two or three times higher than those generally quoted for the Pacific.

However, the paradigm of a quasiperiodic \"ENSO cycle,\" phase locked with the annual march, does not capture the complexity of the evolution of the anomalies. The inadequacy of this model was particularly apparent during the second half of TOGA when the variability was highly aperiodic. Also, a single modal structure or empirical orthogonal function does not appear to be capable of representing the range of spatial patterns of ocean-atmosphere interaction in the tropical Pacific. These results suggest the need for a more inclusive phenomenological description of ENSO.

Ice motion also directly provides the advective component of the equations governing the mass balance of the sea ice cover. Thus its routine observation from space would be of great value to understanding ice and ocean behavior. To demonstrate the feasibility of creating a global multidecadal ice motion record from satellite passive microwave imagery and to quantitatively assess the errors in the estimated ice motions, we have tracked ice every 3 days in the Arctic Ocean and daily in the Fram Strait and Baffin Bay during the 8 winter months from October 1992 to May 1993 and daily in the Weddell Sea during the 8 winter months from March to October 1992. The method, which has been well used previously, involves finding the spatial offset that maximizes the cross correlation of the brightness temperature fields over 100-km patches in two images separated in time by from 1 to 3 days. The resulting ice motions are compared with contemporaneous buoy- and SAR-derived ice motions, The uncertainties in the displacement vectors, between 5 and 12 km, are better than the spatial resolution of the data. Both 85-GHz data with 12-km spatial resolution and 37-GHz data with 25-km resolution are tracked. These trials with the 37-GHz data are new and show quite surprisingly that the error is only about 1 km larger with these data than with the 12-km 85-GHz data, Errors are typically larger than average in areas of lower ice concentration; in the most dynamic regions, particularly near the ice edge in the Barents and Greenland Seas; and in zones of high shear. These passive microwave ice motions show a large increase in spatial detail over motion fields optimally interpolated from buoy and wind observations, especially where buoy data are virtually absent such as near coasts and in some passages between the Arctic Ocean and its peripheral seas. The feasibility of obtaining ice motion from the 37-GHz data in addition to the 85-GHz data should allow an important record of ice motion to be established for the duration of the scanning multichannel microwave radiometer (SMMR), special sensor microwave/imager (SSM/I), and future microwave sensors, that is, from 1978 into the next millenium.\\nC1 CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA.\\n   Univ Karlsruhe, Inst Meteorol & Klimaforsch, D-76128 Karlsruhe, Germany.\\n   Univ Washington, Coll Ocean & Fisheries Sci, Appl Phys Lab, Polar Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.\\nRP Kwok, R (通讯作者)，CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, 4800 Oak Grove Dr, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA.\\nRI Kottmeier, Christoph/A-9553-2013; Kwok, Ronald/L-3968-2019; Kwok,\\n   Ron/A-9762-2008\\nOI Kottmeier, Christoph/0000-0002-2196-2052; Kwok,\\n   Ronald/0000-0003-4051-5896; Kwok, Ron/0000-0003-4051-5896\\nNR 13\\nTC 167\\nZ9 173\\nU1 0\\nU2 26\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

The proper form of this deceptively simple-looking equation, delta p/delta z = -g rho(S, T, p) (where notation is standard), is nonlinear in the pressure p. In contrast, most numerical models solve the linear equation delta p/delta z = -g rho(S, T, z). This modification essentially replaces the total pressure, which includes a time-dependent signal, with an approximate time-independent pressure associated with the depth of a model grid point. In this paper, the authors argue that the inclusion of the total pressure when solving the hydrostatic equation can generate a depth-dependent baroclinic pressure gradient equivalent to a geostrophic velocity of several centimeters per second. Further, this effective velocity can increase with depth and is largest in dynamically important areas like western boundary currents. These points suggest that the full feedback of pressure on density should be included in numerical models. Examples of the effect using oceanic data and output from a typical primitive equation model run are discussed. Finally, algorithms for both rigid-lid and free surface models that explicitly include full pressure are derived, and some related numerical issues are discussed.\\nC1 Florida State Univ, Dept Oceanog, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.\\n   CSIRO, Div Marine Res, Hobart, Tas, Australia.\\nRP Dewar, WK (通讯作者)，Florida State Univ, Dept Oceanog, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.\\nEM bill@ocean.ocean.fsu.edu\\nRI McDougall, Trevor J/A-6770-2013\\nNR 21\\nTC 27\\nZ9 27\\nU1 0\\nU2 4\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA\\nSN 0022-3670\\nEI 1520-0485\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

The seasonal net heat flux and heat storage rates were calculated for the North Pacific Ocean from 1950 to 1990 on a spatial resolution of 5 degrees x 5 degrees. Temperature profiles from the National Ocean Data Center were used to calculate the heat storage rates. Satellite remotely sensed solar irradiance and ship marine weather reports from the Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set were used to calculate the net surface heat flux. Heat storage rates were calculated as the time rate of change of the heat content integrated from the surface down to the isotherm that was 1 degrees C less than the coldest locally observed wintertime sea surface temperature, which was defined as the locally observed wintertime ventilation isotherm. The monthly climatology of the 5 degrees x 5 degrees resolution net heat flux was balanced by the heal storage rate for most regions of the North Pacific. To achieve this balance the net heat flux was calculated using the Liu et al. formulations for latent and sensible heat exchange and a modified version of the Reed cloud correction for solar insolation. The root-mean-square error in the difference between the net heat flux and heat storage rate climatologies was calculated at 40 W m(-2). When the individual temperature profiles from the northeastern portion of the basin were normalized to the local 300-m mean temperature, thereby removing some of the potential local changes caused by barotropic variability of water motion, the root-mean-square error in this region was further reduced to 20 W m(-2) and the large-scale semiannual periodicity in the difference observed in the subtropics was removed. This normalization process may have removed some of the basin-scale variability in the horizontal heat advection. An estimate of the northward heat transport was calculated by integrating the annual mean net heat flux over the North Pacific. The resulting heat transport values were closer to actual northward heat transport estimates made at 10 degrees, 24 degrees, 35 degrees, and 47 degrees N, than previous ocean heat flux estimates. The bias in the data was estimated to be less than 7% by comparing the demeaned seasonal cycle of the net heat flux with that of the heat storage rates. The annual mean net heat flux was then used with the 7% bias and the 20 W m(-2) uncertainty to calculate a more constrained error envelope for the annual mean northward heat transport in the North Pacific.\\nC1 Scripps Inst Oceanog, Phys Oceanog Res Div, La Jolla, CA USA.\\nRP Moisan, JR (通讯作者)，Long Isl Univ, Southampton Coll, Div Nat Sci, Southampton, NY 11968 USA.\\nEM jmoisan@southampton.linnet.edu\\nRI Moisan, John/B-8762-2016\\nOI Moisan, John/0000-0002-8078-8939\\nNR 49\\nTC 143\\nZ9 145\\nU1 1\\nU2 21\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA\\nSN 0022-3670\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

Conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) data collected in the eastern East China Sea in December 1993 and late April/early May 1995 were also analyzed. Composite trajectories of 172 drogued drifters provided direct evidence of the separation of the northeastward flowing Kuroshio into two parts at the western mouth of the deep trough southwest of Kyushu. The Kuroshio main stream turns to the east toward the Tokara Strait, and a northward flowing branch current penetrates onto the shelf across the continental slope west of the trough. Analysis of the CTD data and drifter trajectories, concurrently observed, shows that the branch current was part of the inshore Kuroshio, just upstream before its separation. During the periods of CTD observations, the separated, inshore Kuroshio water intruded northward in a tongue shape along the shelf break of the trough and penetrated onto the shelf after crossing obliquely the western continental slope of the trough. The water that penetrated onto the shelf continued to flow northward toward the Korea Strait. The main path of this water was easily traced by its high salinity, which is characteristic of the inshore Kuroshio water. Application of an inverse method to the observed CTD data also supports the separation and penetration of the Kuroshio and calculates the volume transport of the northward branch to be about 4.0 x 10(6) m(3)/s for the two different surveys. The tongue-shaped intrusion of the inshore Kuroshio water onto the outer shelf may take place in close association with the eastward turning of the Kuroshio main stream and it might be caused by the vorticity adjustment created by the eastward turning of the Kuroshio.\\nC1 Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.\\n   Korea Ocean Res & Dev Inst, Phys Oceanog Div, Ansan, South Korea.\\n   Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Dept Oceanog, Keelung 20224, Taiwan.\\nRP Lie, HJ (通讯作者)，Korea Ocean Res & Dev Inst, Phys Oceanog Div, Ansan POB 29, Seoul 425600, South Korea.\\nEM hjlie@kordi.re.kr; pniiler@ucsd.edu; hu@vaw.ntou.oce.edu\\nNR 27\\nTC 94\\nZ9 114\\nU1 0\\nU2 9\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

We show that during a period of anomalously high sinking POC flux to the deep sea (September 1994), Delta(14)C of suspended POC did not decrease detectably between 85 and 1600 m depth. This is in contrast to depth profiles during low and moderate fluxes of sinking POC at this station where Delta(14)C-POCsusp decreased 50-60 parts per thousand in this depth range. One explanation for the constant Delta(14)C values of POCsusp between 85 and 1600 m is that large quantities of sinking POC could continuously release labile, C-14-enriched POCsusp during biological and chemical alteration of the sinking POC. The radiocarbon evidence further suggests that resuspension of organic carbon from the sediment surface, either locally or laterally transported from the slope to the deep sea, is likely, but is probably limited to depths within a few hundred meters of the bottom. Sorption of \\'old\\' DOC by suspended particulate matter in the water column is also possible, especially at shallower depths( < 3500 m), though proof of this mechanism cannot be demonstrated at this time.

Total organic carbon concentrations and integrated stocks in the upper ocean varied both spatially and seasonally. Highest mixed-layer TOC concentrations (80-100 mu M C) were observed near the coast when upwelling was not active, while upwelling tended to reduce local concentrations. In the open ocean, highest mixed-layer TOC concentrations (80-95 mu M C) developed in winter (period of the NE Monsoon) and remained through mid summer (early to mid-SW Monsoon). Lowest open ocean mixed-layer concentrations (65-75 mu M C) occurred late in the summer (late SW Monsoon) and during the Fall Intermonsoon period. The changes in TOC concentrations resulted in seasonal variations in mean TOC stocks (upper 150 m) of 1.5-2 mole C m(-2), with the lowest stocks found late in the summer during the SW Monsoon-Fall Intermonsoon transition. The seasonal accumulation of TOC north of 15 degrees N was 31-41 x 10(12) g C, mostly taking place over the period of the NE Monsoon, and equivalent to 6-8% of annual primary production estimated for that region in the mid-1970s. A net TOC production rate of 12 mmole C m(-2) d(-1) over the period of the NE Monsoon represented approximate to 80% of net community production. Net TOC production was nil during the SW Monsoon, so vertical export would have dominated the export terms over that period. Total organic carbon concentrations varied in vertical profiles with the vertical layering of the water masses, with the Persian Gulf Water TOC concentrations showing a clear signal. Deep water (>2000 m) TOC concentrations were uniform across the basin and over the period of the cruises, averaging 42.3 +/- 1.4 mu M C. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Anaerobic thermophiles were cultured from 17 of 22 plume samples at levels exceeding 200 organisms per liter; no thermophiles were cultured from any of 12 samples of background seawater. As these microorganisms grow at temperatures of 50-90 degrees C, they could not have grown in the event plume and instead most probably derived from a subseafloor environment tapped by the event plume source fluids. Event plumes are thought to derive from a pre-existing subseaffoor fluid reservoir, which implies that these thermophiles are members of a native subseaffoor community that was present before the eruptive event. Thermophiles also were cultured from continuous chronic-style hydrothermal plumes in April 1996; these plumes may have formed from cooling lava piles. To better understand the nutritional, chemical, and physical constraints of preeruptive crustal environments, seven coccoidal isolates from the two event plumes were partially characterized. Results from nutritional and phylogenetic studies indicate that these thermophiles are heterotrophic archaea that represent new species, and probably a new genus, within the Thermococcales.

Steady flow patterns of a weakly viscous homogeneous model are considered. When viscosity is weak and a no-slip boundary condition is given, the boundary current crosses the shelf/slope offshore controlled by the ageostrophic term in the momentum balance so that the velocity change along the path is small. The path is similar to the inertial boundary layer model with a velocity front. It is independent of the viscous coefficient as long as it is. weak. When a free-slip condition is given, the boundary current follows the coastline without being detached from the coastline. The width of the shelf changes the nature of the boundary current considerably. For both boundary conditions, two separate jets are made. The offshore jet, which carries most transport of the gyre, tends to follow a contour of SIH. A critical shelf width divides two classifications for each boundary condition. It has a different value for each condition.\\nC1 Oita Univ, Fac Educ, Dept Earth Sci, Oita 87011, Japan.\\nRP Nishigaki, H (通讯作者)，Florida State Univ, Dept Oceanog 3048, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.\\nRI Nishigaki, Hajime/R-5242-2019\\nOI Nishigaki, Hajime/0000-0001-6307-2747\\nNR 17\\nTC 0\\nZ9 0\\nU1 0\\nU2 0\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA\\nSN 0022-3670\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

The investigation is motivated by observations from the Coastal Ocean Dynamics Experiment. A central assumption is that the vertical structure of the response over the inshore half of the shelf is controlled by the vertical distribution of the turbulent stress. This suggests a two-layer model of the wind-driven circulation, in which the upper layer represents a surface wind-mixed layer, and the lower layer represents the remainder of the fluid. The response of this idealized dynamical model to wind forcing is examined and compared with observations in the 2-7-day period band. For the alongshore velocity gain relative to local wind stress, an onshore surface maximum and an offshore interior maximum are robustly reproduced by the model. These features are evidently related to a dynamical transition over the inner half of the shelf, in which the alongshore wind stress is balanced more by acceleration of near-surface alongshore flow and less by time-dependent Ekman transport as the coast is approached. This differs from a previous hypothesis, based on a linear model in which the turbulent stress was confined to infinitesimally thin surface and bottom boundary layers, which related the alongshore how structure to the cross-shore profile of the alongshore wind amplitude. In the present model, the cross-shore velocity variances are roughly comparable to those observed over the onshore half of the shelf. This also contrasts with the previous model results, which underpredicted cross-shore velocity variances by more than an order of magnitude. However, the present agreement is probably fortuitous, as the enhanced lower-layer cross-shore flow is frictionally driven, and should probably be confined to a bottom boundary layer as it was in the previous model. The results demonstrate that the response of these models over the inner half of the shelf depends strongly on a poorly understood coastal boundary condition.\\nC1 Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Phys Oceanog, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\nRP Samelson, RM (通讯作者)，Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Phys Oceanog, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\nNR 27\\nTC 9\\nZ9 9\\nU1 0\\nU2 0\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA\\nSN 0022-3670\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

Measurements of isotopic fluctuations in snow, frost, and atmospheric water vapor samples collected during summer field seasons (up to 20 parts per thousand) are compatible with the large and abrupt O-18/O-16 changes observed in accumulated firn. Snow pit delta(18)O profiles from the GISP2 summit area, however, show rapid smoothing of the O-18/O-16 signal near the surface. Beyond about 2-m depth the smoothed delta(18)O signal is fairly well preserved and can be interpreted in terms of average local weather conditions and climate. The longer climate fluctuations also have regional and often global significance. In the older part of the record, corresponding to marine isotope stages (MIS) 5a to 5d, the effect of orbital climate forcing via the 19- and 23-kyr precession cycles and the 41-kyr obliquity cycle is obvious. From the end of MIS 5a, at about 75,000 years B.P., till the end of the glacial at the Younger Dryas-Preboreal transition, at 11,650 years B.P., the (OO)-O-18/O-16 record shows frequent, rapid switches between intermediate interstadial and low stadial values. Fourier spectra of the oscillations that are superimposed on the orbitally induced changes contain a strong periodicity at 1.5 kyr, a broad peak at 4.0 kyr, and additional shorter periods. Detailed comparison of the GISP2 O-18/O-16 record with the Vostok, Antarctica, delta D record; Pacific Ocean foraminiferal O-18/O-16; Grande Pile, France, tree pollen; and insolation indicates that a counterpart to many of the rapid O-18/O-16 fluctuations Of GISP2 can be found in the other records, and that the GISP2 isotopic changes clearly are the local expression of climate changes of worldwide extent. Correlation of events on the independent GISP2 and SPECMAP time scales for the interval 10,000-50,000 years B.P. shows excellent chronometric agreement, except possibly for the event labeled 3.1. The glacial to interglacial transition evidently started simultaneously in the Arctic and the Antarctic, but its development and its expression in Greenland isotopes was later suppressed by the influence of meltwater, especially from the Barents Sea ice sheet, on deep water formation and ocean circulation. Meltwaters from different ice sheets bordering the North Atlantic also influenced ocean circulation during the Bolling-Allerod interstadial complex and the Younger Dryas and led to a distinct development of European climate and Greenland O-18/O-16 values. The Holocene interval with long-term stable mean isotopic values contains several fluctuations with periods from years to millennia. Dominant is a 6.3-year oscillation with amplitude up to 3 to 4 parts per thousand. Periodicities of 11 and 210 years, also found in the solar-modulated records of the cosmogenic isotopes Be-10 and C-14, suggest solar processes as the cause of these cycles. Depression of O-18/O-16 values (cooling) by volcanic eruptions is observed in stacked GISP2 delta(18)O records, but the effect is small and not likely to trigger major climate changes.\\nC1 UNIV WASHINGTON,DEPT GEOL SCI,SEATTLE,WA 98195.\\n   UNIV WASHINGTON,QUATERNARY RES CTR,SEATTLE,WA 98195.\\nRI Grootes, Pieter M/F-4952-2011\\nOI Grootes, Pieter/0000-0003-4265-3168\\nNR 92\\nTC 655\\nZ9 680\\nU1 1\\nU2 109\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

The ECM detected seasonal variations in the nitrate concentration of the core which were used to assist in dating the core by annual layer counting. Volcanic eruptions that produce acidic aerosols are recorded in the ECM record. Evidence of biomass burning is detected by the ECM because fire-related ammonium emissions neutralize the acids in the core. Rapid climate transitions associated with the Younger Dryas and Dansgaard/Oeschger interstadial events alter the concentration of alkaline dust and are detected by the ECM. The ECM has been used to develop stratigraphic ties between the GISP2 and the Greenland Ice Core Project cores.

The very gentle slopes of real oceanic boundaries raise the possibility that dissipation by lateral diffusion of vorticity to the boundary is largely removed, leaving dissipation only in bottom Ekman layers. The laboratory model is a modification of the rotating \\'sliced-cylinder\\' introduced by Pedlosky and Greenspan (1967) and Beardsley (1969) and in which how is driven by a differentially rotating lid. The vertical wall is replaced with a side wall having a uniform 45 degrees slope around the entire perimeter. This sloping boundary, like a continental slope, tends to steer the flow along the slope. In the geometry chosen for this study it also provides closed potential vorticity contours through every point in the basin, thus removing the blocked contours of the experiments with a vertical wall and the open contours of ocean basins that approach the equator. For cyclonic forcing there is a northward (Sverdrup) flow in the interior superimposed on a zonal flow so that a particle starts out at the southwest, enters the slope region in the northwest, circles cyclonically along a circle of constant radius (and depth) to a point on the southeast where it crosses constant depth contours and rejoins the original point. The direction of flow is reversed for anticyclonic forcing. The main dissipation of vorticity takes place in the southeast where the flow crosses constant depth contours. For cyclonic forcing the how is stable and steady under all conditions achieved. For anticyclonic forcing the laboratory flow is unsteady under all conditions attainable and unstable to eddy shedding at sufficiently large Rossby or Reynolds numbers. At large Ekman numbers the onset of instability corresponds to shedding of cyclonic eddies in the region where the boundary current enters the interior, whereas at small Ekman numbers it corresponds to periodic breakup of an anticyclonic gyre in the \\'northwest\\' and the formation of anticyclonic eddies. Eddies of bath sign are shed when the forcing is sufficiently supercritical and the Ekman number small. A simple, qualitative argument explains why the cyclonic flow is stable and the anticyclonic Bow is unstable when the system is nonlinear.\\nC1 Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.\\n   Yale Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.\\nRP Griffiths, RW (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.\\nRI griffiths, ross w/E-6121-2010\\nOI griffiths, ross w/0000-0002-5291-1178\\nNR 15\\nTC 13\\nZ9 13\\nU1 0\\nU2 1\\nPU KLINE GEOLOGY LABORATORY\\nPI NEW HAVEN\\nPA YALE UNIV, NEW HAVEN, CT 06520-8109 USA\\nSN 0022-2402\\nJ9 J MAR RES\\nJI J.

The annual cycle of the modeled mixed layer temperature, salinity, and depth are compared to observations from the drifting ice stations of the Arctic Ice Dynamics Joint Experiment (AIDJEX). The role of the ice thickness distribution in determining the ice/ocean coupling is examined. We find that the ice thickness distribution is important for the exchange of heat, salt, and fresh water between the ice and the ocean, especially with regard to the effects of thin, first-year ice. Several different parameterizations of the ice/ocean turbulent heat exchange are compared. The results indicate that the storage of heat in the ocean mixed layer is an important physical process for determining the annual average ice thickness. Double diffusion and the stabilizing effects of meltwater also impact the exchange of heat between the ocean and ice cover. Questions remain as to the relative importance of these processes and their accurate parameterization in ice/ocean coupled models.\\nC1 Univ Colorado, Dept Aerosp Engn, Program Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.\\nRP Holland, MM (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Dept Aerosp Engn, Program Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Campus Box 429, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.\\nOI Holland, Marika/0000-0001-5621-8939\\nNR 33\\nTC 23\\nZ9 28\\nU1 1\\nU2 5\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

Directional wave spectra were obtained simultaneously from a 6- or 3-wire wave-staff array mounted at the bow of the ship. One hundred and twenty-six 17-minute runs of flux and wave data obtained with the ship steaming slowly into the wind are examined for the effects of the relative direction of the wind sea and background swell on the momentum transfer. The adequacy of the inertial dissipation method, which depends on the high-frequency turbulent fluctuations for evaluating the wind stress, is also examined for any effects of swell.\\n   The results show that the presence of counter-and cross-swells can result in drag coefficients that are much larger than the value for a pure wind sea. The eddy correlation and inertial dissipation methods for measuring wind stress are found to diverge during the complex sea conditions. The authors interpret the latter observations as an indication that the traditional inertial dissipation method, in which the pressure and transport terms in the kinetic energy balance equation are assumed to be in balance, may be unsuitable for use in a marine boundary layer disturbed by swell.\\nC1 ENVIRONM CANADA,CANADA CTR INLAND WATERS,NATL WATER RES INST,BURLINGTON,ON L7R 4A6,CANADA.\\n   UNIV WASHINGTON,SEATTLE,WA 98195.\\nOI Drennan, William/0000-0003-1708-4311\\nNR 24\\nTC 184\\nZ9 188\\nU1 1\\nU2 26\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693\\nSN 0022-3670\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

Upwelling due to the formation of cyclonic eddies and their intensification caused by interaction with surrounding mesoscale features causes spatially and temporally intermittent fluxes of nitrate into the euphotic zone. The annual flux resulting from this eddy upwelling process is of the order of 0.5 mol N m(-2) year-1, which is sufficient to sustain a rate of new primary production that is consistent with estimates for this region derived from budgets of oxygen and other dissolved gases.

The model is valid for large variations in the Coriolis parameter and layer thickness, typical of dynamics at the gyre scale and larger, as well as for mesoscale dynamics in which the advection of relative vorticity cannot be neglected. For length scales much larger than the deformation radius the dominant balances in the model equations are those of the planetary geostrophic equations, whereas for synoptic scales the dynamics of the model are asymptotically close to those of the quasigeostrophic equations. The model consists of the advection of a geostrophic potential vorticity, and is is therefore conceptually simple and numerically easy to implement, requiring the solution of just one linear elliptic equation each time step. It is compared to the shallow-water equations and various other approximate models in order to assess its validity for modeling meso- and large-scale dynamics. Simulations are performed in both a periodic channel and also in a closed domain with wind stress forcing. The formulation is found to yield a substantial improvement in the qualitative nature of the circulation patterns, and in quantitative accuracy, over the planetary geostrophic and (especially) the quasigeostrophic equations, while still retaining much of the conceptual simplicity of those equations.\\nC1 UNIV CALIF SANTA CRUZ, DEPT OCEAN SCI, SANTA CRUZ, CA 95064 USA.\\nNR 30\\nTC 9\\nZ9 9\\nU1 0\\nU2 2\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA\\nSN 0022-3670\\nEI 1520-0485\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

The oxygen minimum layer appeared to be an important factor influencing the vertical distribution of zooplankton taxa below the thermocline. The maximum zooplankton in terms of biomass and numbers was in the thermocline zone, with a secondary maximum in the depth zone that included the lower OMZ interface (600-1000 m). Most taxonomic groups showed this secondary peak in abundance in the lower OMZ interface depth zone and minimum abundances above it. The secondary maximum in zooplankton at the lower OMZ interface seems to be unique to OMZ regions. Only larvaceans and mollusks did not appear to be strongly influenced by the minimum concentrations of oxygen. Four vertical distribution patterns characteristic of different taxonomic groups may be indicative of their different tolerances to minimum oxygen concentrations. The physical intrusion of the seamount (summit at 730 m depth) did not cause major changes in the distribution of pelagic zooplankton. Significant biological and physical differences between locations above and away from the seamount were found only within the upper OMZ (100-300 m).

Daily maps of all data on a regular grid were created using optimal estimation; from these maps the tendency and advection terms in the heat equation were calculated. The mapped vertical motions w agree well with w observed contemporaneously along isopycnal RAFOS float tracks. Strong events occur frequently within the Gulf Stream: diagnosed vertical motions greater than 2 mm s(-1) that persist for days are common, occurring roughly every week within the 250-km mapped region. Upwelling and downwelling regions have horizontal scales of about 100 km both along and across stream. Case studies and animation elucidate the relationship between meander properties and the and amplitude of the w fields: typically, the largest ur is positioned near the steepest thermocline slope, downwelling/upwelling occurs entering/exiting troughs, strongest vertical motions occur in slowly propagating features, and vertical motions are usually weaker for rapidly propagating features. This observed dependence upon phase speed is opposite to predictions of recent kinematic and conceptual models, The main contribution to observed w (and the factor missing in those models) is the existence of strong abyssal flow, serving as a barotropic reference for the entire water column, with a component which may flow orthogonal to the baroclinic front along sloping isopycnals. The strongest vertical and cross-frontal components are usually associated with slowly moving, or stalled, steep meanders, associated with which abyssal cyclones or anticyclones have developed. The vertical motion which is forced in these cases can significantly alter the vertical vorticity and/or frontal strength through tilting of the strong vertical shear and of the strong vertical stratification. Vertical and cross-frontal transports of 5 Sv occur in steep meanders.\\nC1 UNIV RHODE ISL,GRAD SCH OCEANOG,NARRAGANSETT,RI 02882.\\nNR 24\\nTC 36\\nZ9 36\\nU1 0\\nU2 1\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

Evidence is presented that for bubble diameters less than about 3 mm, bubble films do not disintegrate but roll up, forming a toroidal ring that gains mass as it advances toward the film edge. It is suggested that film drops are created when this rolled-up mass \\'\\'hits\\'\\' the edge of the film and hypothesized that the peak in production arises because of a competition between an increase in the mass of the rolled-up toroid and a decrease in its speed as bubble size increases. In this scenario the location of the break in the film is an important parameter. Measurements of this break point are provided. The theory provides an estimate of the bubble size dependence of the number and size of the film drops. The predicted number of droplets per bubble is less and the droplet sizes are larger than the values reported by Blanchard and Syzdek. The theory uses one adjustable parameter that fits the onset of film drop production observed by Blanchard and Syzdek and, in so doing, glosses over the complexities of the toroid impact with the film edge. The possibility that some \\'\\'film\\'\\' drops are perhaps, in reality, jet drops generated by bubbles created by film drop impacts with the water\\'s surface is advanced.\\nRP Spiel, DE (通讯作者)，USN,POSTGRAD SCH,DEPT PHYS,MONTEREY,CA 93943, USA.\\nNR 25\\nTC 27\\nZ9 33\\nU1 1\\nU2 9\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

The data are a combination of in situ and ship-based measurements and show that the process of flee thickening is highly dependent on ice deformation; in particular, rafting and ridging play important roles at different stages of flee development. Rafting is the major mechanism in the early stages of development, and core structure data show the mean thickness of individual layers of crystals to be only 0.12 m. Most ice <0.3 m is not ridged but is usually rafted before attaining this thickness, well before thermodynamic growth has ceased. In thicker flees, ridging is more common, with most floes >0.6 m having some surface deformation. Blocks within ridge sails are typically in the range 0.3-0.6 m thick, and ship-based observations estimate approximately 25% of the pack exhibits surface ridging. When corrected for biases in the observational methods, the data show that the dominant ice and snow thickness categories are >0.7 m and 0.2-0.5 m, respectively, and account for 40% and 36% of the surface area of the pack ice. Approximately 8% of the pack is open water. An estimate of the effects of ridging on the distribution of ice mass within the pack suggests that between 50 and 75% of the total mass is contained within the 25% of the pack that exhibits surface ridging.\\nC1 AUSTRALIAN ANTARCTIC DIV, HOBART, TAS 7001, AUSTRALIA.\\n   INST ANTARTICO CHILENO, SANTIAGO 9, CHILE.\\n   UNIV ALASKA, INST GEOPHYS, FAIRBANKS, AK 99775 USA.\\nRP Worby, AP (通讯作者)，ANTARCTIC COOPERAT RES CTR, POB 252-80, HOBART, TAS 7001, AUSTRALIA.\\nRI Worby, Anthony P/A-2373-2012; Jaña, Ricardo/AAR-1225-2020; Jaña, Ricardo\\n   A/D-7543-2013\\nOI Jaña, Ricardo/0000-0003-3319-1168; Jaña, Ricardo A/0000-0003-3319-1168\\nNR 29\\nTC 72\\nZ9 75\\nU1 0\\nU2 5\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

Previous observations have shown that this is an area in which Middle Atlantic Eight sub-pycnocline (\\'\\'cold pool\\'\\') shelf water flows offshore, directly across isobaths, eventually becoming entrained in the north wall of the Gulf Stream. Hydrographic observations from the summers of 1990 and 1991 are used to show two different scenarios for the interaction of Gulf Stream water with the shelf flow. A high resolution cross-shelf transect was also sampled off New Jersey in each year to provide contrasting frontal structure well north of Cape Hatteras. In 1991 off New Jersey, shipboard velocity measurements indicated a baroclinic jet at the shelfbreak front, with a maximum along-shelf velocity of 0.5 m s(-1). Large cross-frontal density gradients were located near both the bottom outcrop of the front as well as in the seasonal pycnocline, resulting in two distinct velocity maxima, one above and one below the seasonal pycnocline. The latter was associated with a pycnocline salinity maximum extending from the continental slope shoreward across the shelfbreak. The frontal structure near Cape Hatteras was very different, due to the presence of Gulf Stream water over the continental shelf and slope. In June 1990, the shelf water was diverted offshore 100 km north of Cape Hatteras, with Gulf Stream water present over the shelf farther south. Estimated geostrophic eastward velocities at the 1000-m isobath were 0.2 m s(-1) (relative to 100 m). In 1991, Gulf Stream water was present over the upper slope, abutting the shelf water, but was not present over the shelf during the brief (3-day) survey. However, the near-surface Gulf Stream water over the upper slope was less dense than the shelf water and drove a northward flow of 0.2 m s(-1) in the upper 30 m of the water column. In both cases, large along-isobath density gradients were present at the 1000-m isobath, consistent with geostrophic offshore flows of up to 0.2 m s(-1). Thus, the presence of Gulf Stream water may affect the shelf circulation north of Cape Hatteras in at least two different ways: by either flooding the shelf and diverting the southwestward flow of water from the Middle Atlantic Eight directly offshore well north of Cape Hatteras, or by reversing the density gradients normally associated with the shelfbreak front and potentially allowing the shelf water to move offshore along downward-sloping isopycnals.

The effect of dilution and mixing on this cycle is examined using a simple model for production and consumption coupled to three different mixed layer models. The magnitude and timing of the peak concentration, the magnitude of the average concentration, and the air-sea flux are considered. The models are run through a range of heating and wind stress and compared to experimental data reported by Kettle [1994]. The key to the dynamics is the relative size of four length scales; D-mix, the depth to which mixing occurs over the consumption time; I,, the length scale over which production occurs; L(out), the depth to which the mixed layer is ventilated over the consumption time; and L(comp), the depth to which the diurnal production can maintain a concentration in equilibrium with the atmosphere. If D-mix much greater than L, the actual model parameterization can be important. If the mixed layer is maintained by turbulent diffusion, D-mix can be substantially less than the mixed layer depth. If the mixed laver is parameterized as a homogeneous slab, D-mix is equivalent to the mixed layer depth. If D-mix > L(out), production is balanced by consumption rather than outgassing. The ratio between D-mix and L(comp) determines whether the ocean is a source or a sink for CO, The main thermocline depth H sets an upper limit for D-mix and hence D-mix/L, D-mix/L(out), and D-mix/L(comp). The models are run to simulate a single day of observations. The mixing parameterization is shown to be very important, with a model which mixes using small-scale diffusion producing markedly larger surface concentrations than models which homogenize the mixed layer completely and instantaneously.\\nC1 WOODS HOLE OCEANOG INST, DEPT PHYS OCEANOG, WOODS HOLE, MA 02543 USA.\\nRI Gnanadesikan, Anand/A-2397-2008\\nOI Gnanadesikan, Anand/0000-0001-5784-1116\\nNR 28\\nTC 23\\nZ9 23\\nU1 0\\nU2 6\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

The main objective of these cruises was to determine sources, pathways, and mixing histories of the throughflow water masses for the monsoon extremes. Water mass analysis indicates that the most penetrating route followed by Pacific water occurs within the Makassar Strait. This supports the notion that this strait carries the bulk of the Pacific to Indian throughflow, consisting of North Pacific Subtropical Water (upper thermocline S-max) and North Pacific Intermediate Water (lower thermocline S-min). The more attenuated S-max core during the northwest monsoon relative to the southeast monsoon suggests that the throughflow may slacken in that season. There is only minor contribution within the possible throughflow pathway east of Sulawesi. However, relative salty water of South Pacific origin is observed in the lower thermocline within the Seram and southern Maluku Seas, particularly in the northwest monsoon. Density-driven, sill depth overflow into the deep Banda Sea basin via the Lifamatola Passage also contributes to the total throughflow, though this contribution is likely to be minor. While some of the throughflow has been shown to pass through the Lombok Strait, water mass analysis clearly shows the Makassar throughflow turning into the Flores Sea and Banda Sea before curling southward into the Timer Sea and Indian Ocean.\\nC1 LAMONT DOHERTY EARTH OBSERV, PALISADES, NY 10964 USA.\\nRP Ilahude, AG (通讯作者)，PUSAT PENELITIAN DAN PENGEMBANGAN OSEANOL, LIPI, J1 PASIR PUTIH 1, ANCOL TIMUR, JAKARTA 11001, INDONESIA.\\nRI Gordon, Arnold L/H-1049-2011\\nOI Gordon, Arnold L/0000-0001-6480-6095\\nNR 22\\nTC 69\\nZ9 75\\nU1 2\\nU2 18\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

These have been compared to more indirect flux estimates derived from dissipation rates of turbulent kinetic energy and temperature variance. Because record lengths are limited by the thickness of observed turbulent patches, uncertainties are larger than would be expected from relatively longer horizontal records. The best estimate of dissipation flux coefficient from these data is about 0.15-0.2, but it is characterized by a large range of sample values. This implies mixing efficiencies (flux Richardson numbers) are about 0.13-0.17.

Under average wind conditions observed in Massachusetts Bay, molecular diffusion to the air-sea interface was the primary transport mechanism. Estimated diffusion flux rates ranged from 3.8 to 210 x 10(-17) mol Cu cm(-2) s(-1) , with a mean value of 62 x 10(-17) mol Cu cm(-2) s(-1). Temporal variability in the flux rates was directly related to estimated rates of primary production, presumably due to the biological production of surface-active organic matter within the bulk water. Flux rates due to bubble scavenging were generally 3 orders of magnitude less than those observed for diffusion, with a mean value of 2.3 x 10(-19) mol cm(-2) s(-1) for particulate Cu and 3.7 x 10(-19) mol cm(-2) s(-1) for dissolved Cu. Temporal variability of the estimated bubble-mediated fluxes reflected sensitivity to changes in wind stress, as well as the variablility in concentration of the surface-active forms of copper. Residence times of copper in the sea-surface microlayer, based on a comprehensive estimate of the flux of copper from bulk water and atmospheric sources, ranged from 2 min during a phytoplankton bloom period to 21 min during the winter months. Estimates of the flux of surface active forms of copper from the water column to the air-sea interface suggest that the entire inventory of copper within the surface mixed layer of Massachusetts Bay can be cycled through the microlayer within approximately 50 days. This is of the same timescale as the residence time of copper within the surface mixed layer of Massachusetts Bay, indicating that a major portion of copper within the surface mixed layer will be transported to the microlayer before removal from the mixed layer. The formation and transport of surface-active forms of copper may significantly influence the biogeochemical behavior of copper and, perhaps, other metals within the surface mixed layer.\\nC1 UNIV MASSACHUSETTS, ENVIRONM SCI PROGRAM, BOSTON, MA 02125 USA.\\nRI Wallace, Gordon G/H-1123-2011\\nOI Wallace, Gordon G/0000-0002-0381-7273\\nNR 51\\nTC 6\\nZ9 6\\nU1 0\\nU2 7\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

Approximately 30 eddy-resolving simulations of 100-1000 years duration are analyzed to determine the types of low-frequency variability and to estimate statistical uncertainties in the results.\\n   For parameters close to those leading to a stable antisymmetric solution, the system appears to have several preferred phenomenological regimes, each with distinct total energy levels. These states include a high-energy quasi-stable state; a low-energy, weakly penetrating state; and a state of intermediate energy and modest eddy/ring generation. The low-frequency variability of the model is strongly linked to the irregular transitions between these dynamical regimes.\\n   For a central set of reference parameters, the behavior of the system is investigated for each period in which the total energy remains in certain ranges. The structure of the time-averaged streamfunction and eddy energy fields are observed to have remarkable repeatability from event to event for each state.\\n   A parameter study documents the ways in which the probability distribution function of the total energy depends on the strength and asymmetry of the wind forcing field. As the parameters shift away from those leading to a steady antisymmetric solution, we find that increasing the asymmetry of the wind field or reducing the viscosity decreases the occurrences of the high-energy, quasi-stable state. The low-energy, weakly penetrating state is more robust and exists whenever there is both instability and a certain minimal asymmetry in the forcing. As the wind asymmetry is increased, the distributions shift smoothly (but rapidly) away from the higher-energy states, until only the low-energy state remains.\\nC1 RUTGERS STATE UNIV, INST MARINE & COASTAL SCI, NEW BRUNSWICK, NJ 08903 USA.\\nRP McCalpin, JD (通讯作者)，UNIV DELAWARE, COLL MARINE STUDIES, ROBINSON HALL, NEWARK, DE 19716 USA.\\nNR 18\\nTC 87\\nZ9 87\\nU1 0\\nU2 5\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA\\nSN 0022-3670\\nEI 1520-0485\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

FASINEX took place between January and June 1986 at 27 degrees N, 70 degrees W while LOTUS took place between May and October 1982 at 34 degrees N, 70 degrees W. The frequency-domain transfer function between rate of change of heat and the net surface heat flux is consistent with a one-dimensional heat balance between heating and convergence of vertical turbulent heat flux at timescales longer than the inertial. The observations satisfy the vertically integrated one-dimensional heat equation and indicate that the response to surface heating has been successfully isolated. Within the internal waveband, upward phase propagation in the response is inconsistent with a one-dimensional balance and the vertically integrated heat balance fails. The internal waveband response is explained as a balance between rate of change of heat, mixing, and vertical advection. A simple model, which admits internal waves forced by an oscillatory surface buoyancy flux, illustrates the competition between these three terms. Stratification modulates the depth to which surface heating is mixed. The estimated eddy diffusivity may be considered a linear function of frequency where the scaling constant reflects the mixed layer depth.\\nC1 UNIV WASHINGTON,SCH OCEANOG,SEATTLE,WA 98195.\\n   UNIV CALIF SAN DIEGO,SCRIPPS INST OCEANOG,LA JOLLA,CA 92093.\\nRI Rudnick, Daniel L/J-8948-2016\\nOI Rudnick, Daniel L/0000-0002-2624-7074\\nNR 23\\nTC 3\\nZ9 3\\nU1 0\\nU2 4\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693\\nSN 0022-3670\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

Insight into the mechanism of instability can, therefore, be gained through the use of the ideas of wave over-reflection. For idealized flows, where it can be directly applied, over-reflection successfully predicts the phase speed and wavelength of the most unstable waves. In complex flows, where application is difficult the character of the energy exchanges is consistent with the ideas of over-reflection. Whereas at the scales of the tropical instability waves, instability arises by extracting energy from the background state through varying mixes of baroclinic, barotropic, and Kelvin-Helmholtz mechanisms (depending upon the details of the flow), the importance of the critical layer as the root of instability suggests that attempting to classify the instability through these energy conversions is misleading.\\nRP Proehl, JA (通讯作者)，DARTMOUTH COLL,THAYER SCH ENGN,8000 CUMMINGS HALL,HANOVER,NH 03755, USA.\\nNR 58\\nTC 34\\nZ9 34\\nU1 0\\nU2 1\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693\\nSN 0022-3670\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

A synoptic basin-wide sampling program in 1985 showed that the snowpack exhibits consistent properties across large regions. Typically, the snowpack in the Wyoming region contains large amounts of depth hear, with grain sizes up to 5 lmm, while the snowpack in Colorado and Utah is dominated by rounded snow grains less than 2 mm in diameter. In the Wyoming region, large depth hear crystals in shallow snowpacks yield the lowest emissivities or coldest brightness temperatures observed across the entire basin. Yearly differences in the average grain sizes result primarily from variations in the relative amount of depth hear within the snowpack. The average grain size for the Colorado and Utah regions shows much less variation than do the grain sizes from the Wyoming region. Furthermore, the greatest amounts of depth hear occur in the Wyoming region during 1987 and 1992, years with strong El Nino Southern Oscillation, but the Colorado and Utah regions do not show this behavior.\\nC1 NASA, GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CTR, GREENBELT, MD 20771 USA.\\n   USDA ARS, HYDROL LAB, BELTSVILLE, MD 20705 USA.\\nRP Josberger, EG (通讯作者)，UNIV PUGET SOUND, US GEOL SURVEY, TACOMA, WA 98416 USA.\\nNR 24\\nTC 19\\nZ9 20\\nU1 0\\nU2 3\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

Rotary spectral analysis shows clockwise-rotating energy peaks at near-inertial frequencies for records from all current meter moorings after the suppression of principal tidal signals. The vertical structure of near-inertial oscillations is characterized by a first baroclinic mode with a near 180 degrees phase difference between the upper mixed layer and the lower stratified layer. The oscillations are intermittent with a modulation timescale of about 5-10 days. They are surface-intensified and have maximum values near the shelf break, decaying gradually toward the coast but rapidly offshore. Near-inertial oscillations appear to accompany a sudden change of the wind stress during frontal passages. Diagnostic analysis suggests that the large near-inertial oscillations over the LATEX shelf are mainly generated by high-frequency (near-inertial) variation of the wind stress accompanying the passage of atmospheric fronts. When the downward transfer of the near-inertial energy to the deep stratified layer is small, a simple mixed layer model forced by the observed wind stress provides a reasonable prediction of the near-inertial currents in the mixed layer.\\nC1 TEXAS A&M UNIV, DEPT OCEANOG, COLLEGE STN, TX 77843 USA.\\nRP Chen, CS (通讯作者)，UNIV GEORGIA, DEPT MARINE SCI, ECOL BLDG, ATHENS, GA 30602 USA.\\nNR 30\\nTC 64\\nZ9 65\\nU1 0\\nU2 9\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

The temperature is idealized as a passive tracer forced by a zonally constant Haney condition and advected by a barotropic gyre. The simplicity of the model allows for analytical solutions, which are in fairly good quantitative agreement with the results obtained by Wang et al. using a numerical model. In particular, the maximum heat transport Q occurs when the restoring timescale for temperature is about one-tenth of the time it takes a particle to how around the gyre. Estimates for the actual heat transport carried by the subtropical gyre are 0.2-0.4 PW for the North Atlantic and 0.3-0.6 PW for the North Pacific. Finally, the model shows that when the restoring timescale is short compared to the gyre advection timescale, the heat transport is sensitive to the width of the western boundary current. Potentially this could lead coarse-resolution numerical models to underestimate meridional heat transport, but the actual restoring timescale of the ocean may be too long for this to be an important effect.\\nRP Klinger, BA (通讯作者)，NOVA SE OCEANOG CTR,OCEANOG CTR,8000 N OCEAN DR,DANIA,FL 33004, USA.\\nNR 8\\nTC 6\\nZ9 6\\nU1 0\\nU2 1\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693\\nSN 0022-3670\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

The emphasis was placed upon the exchange of waters between the North and South Atlantic as indicated by the patterns of characteristics.\\n   The exchange with the waters entering through the Drake Passage involves further discussion of the effect of the Atlantic waters in providing a major defining characteristic of the Circumpolar Water - the layer of warm and saline water. The associated features - the high oxygen and low nutrient concentrations - are also defined well for a long distance down stream in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. However it is only the vertical maximum in salinity that persists all along the flow around Antarctica and through the Drake Passage into the South Atlantic. This returning salinity maximum is much lower than the salinity maximum from the north that it meets and mixes with in the South Atlantic. Part of their mixture turns back northward into the South Atlantic where it appears as the vertical maximum in salinity seen in the east, but lower in salinity than the maximum seen along the western boundary. The rest of the mixture continues eastward, with its salinity increased well above that of the Drake Passage water and begins another circuit of Antarctica.\\nRP Reid, JR (通讯作者)，UNIV CALIF SAN DIEGO,SCRIPPS INST OCEANOG,MARINE LIFE RES GRP,LA JOLLA,CA 92093, USA.\\nRI Gerold, Wefer/S-2291-2016\\nOI Gerold, Wefer/0000-0002-6803-2020\\nNR 0\\nTC 45\\nZ9 48\\nU1 0\\nU2 1\\nPU SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN\\nPI BERLIN 33\\nPA HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, W-1000 BERLIN 33, GERMANY\\nBN 3-540-62079-6\\nPY 1996\\nBP 13\\nEP 44\\nPG 32\\nWC Oceanography\\nWE Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)\\nSC Oceanography\\nGA BH55D\\nUT WOS:A1996BH55D00002\\nDA 2022-06-16\\nER\\n\\nPT J\\nAU Chavez, FP\\nAF Chavez, FP\\nTI A comparison of ship and satellite chlorophyll from California and Peru\\nSO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS\\nLA English\\nDT Article\\nID EQUATORIAL PACIFIC; PHYTOPLANKTON\\nAB Ship surface chlorophyll measurements from coastal California and Peru have been processed for comparison with surface chlorophyll estimated during the lifetime of the coastal zone color scanner (CZCS). The ship data shows that chlorophyll concentrations are higher off Peru than California, consistent with the Peru Current system\\'s being more productive. Off California the ship and satellite measurements yield similar estimates of chlorophyll concentration (the average ratio of ship to satellite is 1.1), but off Peru the satellite yields substantially lower concentrations (average ratio of 3.8). The lower satellite values off Peru are likely due to sparse satellite coverage and/or problems with atmospheric corrections. For California, the inshore (0-100 km) ship and satellite chlorophyll estimates are similar, but offshore (200-250 km) the satellite yields higher values. Both estimates, however, confirm the presence of a winter chlorophyll maximum in offshore California waters (likely due to increased nutrient concentrations), increases in chlorophyll per cell, and mixing of subsurface chlorophyll maximum to the surface. Conversely, off Peru, offshore ship and satellite values are in closer agreement than inshore values. As a result onshore-offshore gradients are weaker in the satellite data for both California and Peru. The gradient problem is likely the result of the satellite algorithm. Different algorithms may be needed for coastal waters, dominated by relatively large and colonial phytoplankton, and open ocean waters, dominated by small solitary phytoplankton.\\nRP Chavez, FP (通讯作者)，MONTEREY BAY AQUARIUM RES INST, 160 CENT AVE, PACIFIC GROVE, CA 93950 USA.\\nNR 29\\nTC 48\\nZ9 50\\nU1 0\\nU2 6\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

However, radial orbit error on TOPEX/POSEIDON (T/P) has been reduced to the 3 to 4-cm root-mean-square (rms) level over a 10-day repeat cycle, which represents an order of magnitude improvement over earlier altimetry missions such as Geosat. Consequently, oceanographers are now able to directly evaluate the absolute ocean topography to unprecedented accuracy levels. While significantly reduced, the T/P orbit error still requires quantification. This study examines the spatial and temporal characteristics of the T/P radial orbit error, as assessed through the analysis of laser tracking residuals and orbit comparisons with independently generated trajectories. Spectral analyses of the orbit differences between the orbits determined from satellite laser ranging and Doppler Orbitography and Radiopositioning Integrated by Satellite data and the independently determined reduced dynamic Global Positioning System (GPS) ephemerides indicate that the predominant power is at the once-per-orbital revolution frequency with 2- to 3-cm peaks. When the orbit differences are colinearly aligned to a fixed geographic grid and spectral analysis is performed at each geographic grid point, a nearly 60-day period is found with maximum amplitudes in the 2- to 4-cm range. The contribution of both conservative and nonconservative force and measurement mismodeling to this error signal are assessed. We demonstrate that the similar to 60-day error period seen at fixed geographic locations arises from weaknesses in the dynamic ocean tidal models used in the orbit calculations. New tidal models have been developed which significantly reduce this error. Second-generation orbits incorporating many model improvements have been computed and demonstrate a significant reduction in the radial orbit error signals. Some orbit error still exists, and methods for further model improvements and the possibility of achieving 1-cm radial rms orbit accuracy in T/P are discussed.\\nC1 HUGHES STX CORP, GREENBELT, MD 20770 USA.\\nRP Marshall, JA (通讯作者)，NASA, GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CTR, SPACE GEODESY BRANCH, CODE 926, GREENBELT, MD 20771 USA.\\nRI Luthcke, Scott B/D-6283-2012\\nNR 54\\nTC 70\\nZ9 71\\nU1 0\\nU2 2\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

Absolute velocities were determined using these data and an earlier section at 8N in a linear inverse analysis. Mass balance for several layers representing the main water masses in the region and a zero net divergence for the sum of geostrophic and Ekman transport between the two sections are assumed. Using the annual mean of Ekman transports (13.6 Sv, 14.5N), (15.2 Sv, 8N) based on the climatology by Isemer and Hasse (1985) the annual average fluxes for the sections at 8N and 14.5N have been calculated. For the annual mean the strength of the meridional overturning cell at 14.5N amounts to 15.9 Sv with an associated heat transport of 1.22 PW. A similar value can be obtained at 8N where the annual mean heat transport reaches 1.18 PW and the overturning cell measures 15 Sv. The total northward heat transport is strongly dominated by the wind-driven Ekman heat transport.\\n   \\'In-situ\\' values of heat transport using the actual wind-driven transports for the respective months yield even higher estimates. Heat transport at 14.5N rises to 1.37 +/- 0.42 PW (February) and the maximum is now at the 8N section, 1.69 +/- 0.52 PW (May).\\n   Comparisons of our results with another tropical section at 11N occupied concurrently demonstrate the large variability in heat transport related to changes in the wind field. Due to extremely weak winds in the eastern Atlantic and a resulting low Ekman transport, the \\'in-situ\\' value of heat transport through this section ranged between 0.30 +/- 0.18 PW and 0.59 +/- 0.18 PW depending on the value chosen for the Ekman transport. The lower of the two heat transport estimates results from calculations with the actual observed winds and the other using a monthly climatological mean. That even the computations with the climatological monthly mean give such a low heat transport points to additional changes in the baroclinic structures between 11N and 14.5N.\\nC1 UNIV BREMEN,INST UMWELTPHYS,TRACER OCEANOG ABT,D-28359 BREMEN,GERMANY.\\n   NOAA,ATLANTIC OCEANOG & METEOROL LAB,MIAMI,FL.\\nRP KLEIN, B (通讯作者)，CHRISTIAN ALBRECHTS UNIV KIEL,INST MEERESKUNDE,W-2300 KIEL,GERMANY.\\nNR 36\\nTC 27\\nZ9 29\\nU1 0\\nU2 3\\nPU KLINE GEOLOGY LABORATORY\\nPI NEW HAVEN\\nPA YALE UNIV, NEW HAVEN, CT 06520\\nSN 0022-2402\\nJ9 J MAR RES\\nJI J.

Temperatures in New Zealand were as much as 3 degrees C below average, with heavy rain and unusual snow. The oceanic surface layer in the southwest Pacific was also anomalously cold over the same period. A World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) hydrographic section (P14C) between Auckland and Fiji during September 1992 found cold sea surface temperatures and deep mixed layers near New Zealand when compared to 8 years of high-resolution expendable bathy thermograph (XBT) temperature measurements collected along the same transect. High nutrient and low dissolved oxygen concentrations in the surface layer indicated recent entrainment of thermocline waters. The Auckland to Fiji XBT section is ope of three WOCE high-resolution XBT survey lines in the \\'\\'Tasman Box\\'\\' region, whose boundaries are Auckland-Fiji, Fiji-Brisbane and Wellington-Sydney transects plus the Australian coast. Geostrophic shear and transport were estimated from 10 realizations of the Tasman Box during the period 1991-1993. The time series of geostrophic transport shows that following a convergence in late 1991, early in 1992 there was a substantial divergence of mass in the upper waters, equivalent to a thinning of the warm water layer. The phase of this anomalous divergence is matched to an observed amplification of the seasonal oceanic heat storage cycle in 1991-1992. The top 200-m average temperature was warmer in the 1992 summer than in 1991 or 1993, but the winter of 1992 was the coldest of the 8-year record along the Auckland-Fiji line. The divergence (thinning) of the warm water layer appears to have preconditioned the region for the exceptionally cold 1992 winter. The alternative, cool conditions from anomalous air-sea heat exchange caused by variability in the wind field, is considered unlikely as large fluctuations in heat loss are not observed in the air-sea flux data during this period. The severe weather conditions and anomalous ocean heat transport are most likely related to the prolonged El Nino-Southern Oscillation episode that began in early 1991.\\nC1 DSIR, NEW ZEALAND OCEANOG INST, NATL INST WATER & ATMOSPHER RES, WELLINGTON, NEW ZEALAND.\\n   CSIRO, DIV OCEANOG, HOBART, TAS 7001, AUSTRALIA.\\nRP SPRINTALL, J (通讯作者)，UNIV CALIF SAN DIEGO, SCRIPPS INST OCEANOG, 9500 GILMAN DR, LA JOLLA, CA 92093 USA.\\nNR 17\\nTC 41\\nZ9 41\\nU1 0\\nU2 9\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

A constant negative buoyancy flux is applied in a limited region adjacent to a straight coast to represent brine rejection from ice production in an idealized coastal polynya. A sharp density front forms at the edge of the forcing region, with surface and bottom intensified jets along the front. The flow around the head of the submarine canyon triggers a frontal instability that initially grows only on one side of the canyon. The unstable waves on the other side of the canyon are blocked by a localized barotropic flow that develops near the canyon head. Unstable waves also grow where the forcing region intersects the coast. The frontal waves grow rapidly (with O(1 day) c-folding timescales) and form eddies with horizontal scales of O(15 km) which extract the densest water from the forcing region and carry it offshore, directly across isobaths. In this way the eddies limit the maximum water density that appears in the model despite continued negative buoyancy forcing. Some dense water descends into the canyon, forming a bottom-trapped plume that transports the dense water offshore ahead of the eddies. The plume moves relatively slowly (i.e., small Froude number), with little turbulent entrainment, so the advancement and structure of the plume nose can be described successfully as a simple gravity current with an advective-diffusive heat balance. Eddies may slump into the canyon from the side, altering both the density anomaly and speed of the canyon plume! suggesting that canyon plumes are likely to be highly variable in both space and time.\\nRP CHAPMAN, DC (通讯作者)，WOODS HOLE OCEANOG INST, DEPT PHYS OCEANOG, WOODS HOLE, MA 02543 USA.\\nRI Gawarkiewicz, Glen/R-6199-2019\\nNR 23\\nTC 66\\nZ9 66\\nU1 0\\nU2 6\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

The tracer was injected near 310 m depth in the Canary Basin. Two profile sets were collected 6 months after tracer release, and two were collected 1 year after release, all within the horizontal boundaries of the SF6 patch. Shear and strain can be combined with turbulent kinetic energy dissipation and diffusivity measurements (published elsewhere) to test existing expressions for dissipation and diffusivity due to shear-induced turbulence. These expressions arise from internal-wave decay modeling. One expression of dissipation parameterized in terms of shear, based on stochastic nonlinear internal-wave interaction, has fared well empirically; its extension to estimate diffusivity is evaluated. Shear variance of the first two data sets was about 1.6 times GM76, and 2.5 to 3.0 times GM76 in the later sets. The average parameterized mixing estimate computed using all of the temporally Limited shear measurements overestimates annual mean NATRE diffusivity, 1.5 x 10(-5) m(2) s(-1), by a factor of 1.2. A modified parameterization gives an underestimate. To first order, this supports the present understanding of open-ocean diffusivity in terms of fine-scale shear and internal-wave decay, that is, the slow diapycnal mixing was not a consequence of unusually low shear. Adjustment of the shear-induced mixing models to better fit the data is not warranted because of the lack of direct comparability between the various measurements, the expected natural variability of the shear, and sampling errors.\\nC1 UNIV CALIF SAN DIEGO, SCRIPPS INST OCEANOG, SAN DIEGO, CA 92093 USA.\\nRP DUDA, TF (通讯作者)，WOODS HOLE OCEANOG INST, DEPT APPL OCEAN PHYS & ENGN, BIGELOW 202, WOODS HOLE, MA 02543 USA.\\nRI Duda, Timothy F/A-7282-2010\\nOI Duda, Timothy F/0000-0002-5797-5955\\nNR 40\\nTC 9\\nZ9 9\\nU1 0\\nU2 4\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

Initial settlement was examined under various near-bottom flow regimes, and the interaction of flow with post-settlement behavior was investigated. Cylindrical depressions of constant depth were constructed with a range of aspect ratios (diameter and depth combinations) to mimic natural microtopographic features. Copepods were released into the flume (at nominal flows of 2, 5 and 7 cm sec(-1)), and settlement/distribution in the mimic pits was observed. Four experiments were conducted using a total of five species. The first tested for copepod substrate preferences in still water. The second tested for passive settlement into azoic sediment using predictions, based on hydrodynamics, of the ability of depressions of different aspect ratios to act as passive collectors. The patterns of initial settlement of living, freeze-killed and bead-mimic meiofauna were compared. Algal-enriched sediment (to test for active habitat selection) was used in two experiments; one to test for active choice upon initial settlement and the other to test for active habitat selection via post-settlement dispersal into closely-paired pits. Although copepods were capable of active habitat selection in still water, no species tested was able to initially select the preferred habitat in moving water. Moreover, the same copepod species tested in moving water were generally deposited among depressions in the same manner as passive particles. Post-settlement behavior influenced copepod distribution at a low nominal current velocity (2 cm sec(-1)) as more individuals of both species located (and remained in) algal-enriched depressions after four hrs. Under high flow (8 cm sec(-1)), copepods were unable to select enriched over non-enriched depressions, either because they did not re-emerge from non-enriched pits or because shear velocity was too high to permit active habitat selection.\\nC1 UNIV NEW ORLEANS,DEPT BIOL SCI,NEW ORLEANS,LA 70148.\\n   LOUISIANA DEPT NAT RESOURCES,DIV COASTAL RESTORAT,BATON ROUGE,LA 70804.\\nRP FLEEGER, JW (通讯作者)，LOUISIANA STATE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL & PHYSIOL,BATON ROUGE,LA 70803, USA.\\nRI Fleeger, John W/A-6215-2013\\nOI Yund, Philip/0000-0003-0474-5205\\nNR 58\\nTC 31\\nZ9 32\\nU1 0\\nU2 8\\nPU KLINE GEOLOGY LABORATORY\\nPI NEW HAVEN\\nPA YALE UNIV, NEW HAVEN, CT 06520\\nSN 0022-2402\\nJ9 J MAR RES\\nJI J.

(1991) indicate significant changes in the North Atlantic thermohaline structure and circulation between the pentads 1955-1959 and 1970-1974, using data analyzed by Levitus (1989a,b,c) and a simple diagnostic model by Mellor et al. (1982). In this paper these changes are modeled using a three-dimensional, free surface, coastal ocean model. Diagnostic and short-term prognostic calculations are used to infer the dynamically adjusted fields corresponding to the observed hydrographic and wind stress climatology of each pentad. While the results agree with earlier studies indicating that the Gulf Stream was considerably weaker (by about 30 Sv) during the 1970s compared to the 1950s, they also indicate some changes in the poleward heat transport, although the statistical significance of these changes relative to sampling errors in the data is not clear. The change of wind pattern between the two pentads, associated with changes in sea surface temperature, resulted in changes in the Ekman contribution to the poleward heat flux transport. The modeled sea level along the North American coast shows a sea level rise of about 5-10 cm between 1955-1959 and 1970-1974; a comparison with observed sea level at 15 tide gage stations shows good agreement. Most of the coastal sea level change is attributed to changes in thermohaline ocean circulation and wind stress; thermal expansion seems to play a lesser role. The methodology tested here demonstrates an effective way to estimate climate changes in ocean circulation and sea level from observed hydrographic data and winds using ocean models to enhance and analyze the data.\\nC1 MEM UNIV NEWFOUNDLAND, DEPT PHYS, ST JOHNS, NF A1B 3X7, CANADA.\\nRP EZER, T (通讯作者)，PRINCETON UNIV, PROGRAM ATMOSPHER & OCEAN SCI, POB CN710, SAYRE HALL, PRINCETON, NJ 08544 USA.\\nOI Ezer, Tal/0000-0002-2018-6071\\nNR 31\\nTC 43\\nZ9 43\\nU1 0\\nU2 1\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

The Kelvin waves are observed to be forced west of the date line and propagate at a speed of 2.4 m s(-1), with high zonal coherence over at least 10,000 km. They form a major component of thermocline depth variability in the east-central Pacific. The intraseasonal-band variance has a low-frequency modulation both at the annual and interannual frequencies; higher amplitudes are observed in boreal fall/winter and during the onset phase of El Nino warm events. The oceanic intraseasonal variability and its low-frequency modulation are coherent with atmospheric intraseasonal variations (the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO)), which are known to propagate eastward into the Pacific from the Indian Ocean as part of a planetary-Scale signal. The life cycle of an individual or series of MJOs is determined by a combination of factors including tropical SSTs over the warm pool regions of the Indian and Pacific Oceans and interaction with the planetary-scale atmospheric circulation. Thus the intraseasonal Kelvin waves should be taken as an aspect of a global phenomenon, not simply internal to the Pacific. The oceanic intraseasonal variability peaks at periods near 60-75 days, while the corresponding atmospheric variations have somewhat higher frequencies (35- to 60-day periods). We show that this period offset is potentially related to the zonal fetch of the wind compared to the frequency-dependent zonal wavelength of the Kelvin wave response. A simple model is formulated that suggests an ocean-atmosphere coupling by which zonal advection of SST feeds back to the atmosphere; the model duplicates the steplike advance of warm water and westerly winds across the Pacific at the onset of the El Nino of 1991-1992. The key dynamics of the model is that the atmosphere responds rapidly to the state of the ocean, but the ocean\\'s response to the atmosphere is lagged because it is an integral over the entire wind forcing history felt by the wave. This results in a nonlinear ordinary differential equation that allows a net nonzero low-frequency ocean signal to develop from zero-mean sinusoidal forcing at intraseasonal frequencies.\\nC1 NOAA, CTR CLIMATE DIAGNOST, BOULDER, CO 80303 USA.\\nRP KESSLER, WS (通讯作者)，NOAA, PACIFIC MARINE ENVIRONM LAB, 7600 SAND POINT WAY NE, SEATTLE, WA 98115 USA.\\nRI McPhaden, Michael J/D-9799-2016\\nOI McPhaden, Michael J/0000-0002-8423-5805\\nNR 59\\nTC 351\\nZ9 357\\nU1 1\\nU2 50\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

Surface boundary conditions and the form for the local tangential law are then suggested. The corresponding structure of the WBL above a wave field is illustrated using the JONSWAP spectrum as an example. An analytical model of the stationary boundary layer is constructed. it is shown that close to the surface the wind speed profile is nonlogarithmic, and the mean shear stress is not a quadratic function of wind speed. The roughness parameter has its sense only outside of the WBL. The partitioning of momentum flux between turbulence and wave-induced motions is strongly dependent on the assumed upper frequency bound for the wave spectrum.

The pH dependent terms are attributable to relaxation of B(OH)3 and MgCO3 species, and the ensemble effect has been approximated (Mellen et al., 1987a) as alpha = alpha(1)(MgSO4) + alpha(2)(B(OH)(3)) + alpha(3)(MgCO3), where alpha is the absorption coefficient in decibels per kilometer, and alpha(n) = (S/35)A(n)[f(2)f(n)/(f(2) + f(n)(2))], where S is the salinity, A(n) is the amplitude of each component and depends on pH, f is the frequency, and f(n) is the relaxation frequency. Overall accuracy of +/-15% in a requires that pH be known to 0.05 pH units. The presently used oceanic pH field for sound absorption models is derived from a combination of Geochemical Ocean Sections Study (GEOSECS) data and Soviet data from the 1978 Gorshkov atlas for the North Atlantic where GEOSECS data are absent. We compare the North Atlantic fields with the well-constrained Transient Tracers in the Ocean North Atlantic CO2 data set and find large differences. We further show that sufficiently strong correlations exist between CO2 system variables and other more commonly available hydrographic properties and that improved renditions of the pH field in other regions of the ocean are possible once equivalent local correlations are established, thus leading to greatly improved estimates of the sound absorption field.\\nC1 WOODS HOLE OCEANOG INST, DEPT MARINE CHEM & GEOCHEM, WOODS HOLE, MA 02543 USA.\\nOI Brewer, Peter/0000-0002-5448-0199\\nNR 42\\nTC 54\\nZ9 54\\nU1 0\\nU2 14\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

The integral limits are chosen as +/- 1.5 degrees latitude centered at the equator and +/- 4 degrees longitude centered at the each central longitude. These limits are chosen in order to eliminate the random noise and to enhance the equatorially trapped wave signals. The spatial-integration-filtered SLA time series show periodical signals with different time scales. Processing the SLA time series with a Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) yields the lime-frequency spectra of the SLA which show a frequency spectral splitting-combining phenomenon in the periods during and after the 1986-1987 El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event. Analysis of non-linear wave-wave interaction indicates that this phenomenon results from amplitude modulation of the short period oscillations in the 60-100 day band by a long period oscillation with a period of about 500 days. The wave components of the short period oscillations are further analysed using the equatorial wave modes to fit the meridional distribution of the SLA. The results indicate that the downwelling Kelvin wave mode before and during the peak phase of 1986-1987 ENSO and the upwelling Kelvin wave mode during the 1988 La Nina are the dominant components. The first and second Rossby wave modes play important roles for entire time series and occasionally become the dominant components. The mean phase speed of Kelvin wave mode during the 1986-1987 ENSO is 3.0 m s(-1), which is 25% higher than those in non-ENSO periods.\\nC1 NOAA,GEOSCI LAB,SILVER SPRING,MD 20910.\\nRP ZHENG, QN (通讯作者)，UNIV DELAWARE,GRAD COLL MARINE SCI,CTR REMOTE SENSING,NEWARK,DE 19716, USA.\\nRI Ho, Chung-Ru/ABC-3947-2020; Zheng, Quanan/F-9025-2010; Tai,\\n   C.K./F-5628-2010\\nOI Ho, Chung-Ru/0000-0001-7629-2765\\nNR 39\\nTC 10\\nZ9 10\\nU1 0\\nU2 2\\nPU PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD\\nPI OXFORD\\nPA THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB\\nSN 0967-0637\\nJ9 DEEP-SEA RES PT I\\nJI Deep-Sea Res.

In the upper 50 m, the residual flow in the northern GSC consists of three principal currents: (1) a southward coastal current located along the western flank of the GSC; (2) a broad cyclonic circulation crudely following the local topography in the interior region of the northern GSC; and (3) a northeastward current along the western flank of Georges Bank. Below 50 m, the residual flow tends to be cyclonic along the local 100-m isobath in the northern GSC. These circulation patterns are consistent with the vertical distributions of water properties and the trajectories of satellite-tracked drifters drogued at 5 and 50 m. Comparisons with geostrophic current shears and numerical model results suggest that the residual flow in spring is driven primarily by tidal rectification over the shallower sides of the northern GSC and by buoyancy forcing over the deeper flanks of the GSC. The southward transports of low-salinity plume surface water and Maine Intermediate Water (MIW) were about 0.07 +/- 0.03 Sv and 0.31 +/- 0.38 Sv in April 1988 and about 0.12 +/- 0.06 Sv and 0.66 +/- 0.14 Sv in June 1989. The larger transports of low-salinity plume water and MIW found in June 1989 are believed to be due to the increased freshwater river discharge in 1989 and occurrence of a subsurface coastal jet current along the western flank of the GSC.\\nC1 WOODS HOLE OCEANOG INST,DEPT PHYS OCEANOG,WOODS HOLE,MA 02543.\\nNR 24\\nTC 30\\nZ9 31\\nU1 0\\nU2 1\\nPU PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD\\nPI OXFORD\\nPA THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB\\nSN 0278-4343\\nJ9 CONT SHELF RES\\nJI Cont.

The first region corresponds to the gyre center, where deepwater formation occurs and a large bay forms in the winter ice pack (\\'\\'Nordbukta\\'\\'), and the second region lies directly to the south, in the area usually covered by an ice tongue (\\'\\'Odden\\'\\') in February and March. Surface temperature responds primarily to local surface heat fluxes, consistently warming in the summer to about 4 degrees C and cooling in the fall to the freezing point. Interannual variability appears to be greater for salinity than for temperature. This, coupled with the sparse data coverage, makes it more difficult to define a seasonal salinity cycle. However, in July and August, surface salinity in both regions appears to decrease drastically, with freshening being more pronounced in the southern region. In the fall this mixed-layer fresh anomaly is removed, probably by brine rejection due to the local formation of ice and its subsequent removal by northerly winds. Eventually, ice formation causes the surface waters to overturn and entrain the warmer water below, inhibiting further ice formation. The fresh anomaly is smaller in the gyre center than in the Odden region, so that ice formation will end there earlier, resulting in the appearance of a bay to the north of an ice tongue. Since the disappearance of ice is a necessary precursor to mixing deeper than about 100 m, this suggests that large areal changes in ice cover may be used as a proxy for identifying the strength and onset of deep convection.\\nC1 MIT WOODS HOLE OCEANOG INST JOINT PROGRAM OCEANOG, WOODS HOLE, MA USA.\\nNR 34\\nTC 11\\nZ9 11\\nU1 1\\nU2 2\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

The analysis is based on a \\'\\'stream-coordinate\\'\\' approach, in which velocities are rotated into a local, downstream coordinate frame and averaged according to their relative cross-stream location within the current. The picture so obtained represents the average synoptic structure of the Gulf Stream, rather than the Eulerian-averaged structure in which the current is weakened and broadened by lateral meandering of the current and adjacent recirculations. Many familiar features of the Gulf Stream are reproduced in the analysis, including an asymmetric velocity profile with larger shear on the cyclonic (shoreward) side of the current, an offshore displacement of the velocity core with depth, and a subsurface velocity maximum on the offshore side of the current. Westward recirculations are also seen on both sides of the Gulf Stream. Maximum downstream speeds at the axis of the Gulf Stream reach approximately 2.0 m/s at the surface and 0.7 m/s at 1000 m, roughly twice the corresponding Eulerian-averaged values. The analysis also reveals a deep extension of the Gulf Stream at 3500 m depth with a width of 130 km and average speeds of 3-4 cm/s. The transport of the Gulf Stream in the stream-coordinate frame is 113 +/- 8 Sv, approximately 30% larger than the Eulerian-averaged transport of 88 Sv. On the basis of these results and other recent studies the downstream transport increase of the Gulf Stream and the inflow structure to the Gulf Stream are reconsidered. It is concluded that approximately 30 Sv, or over half of the transport increase between Cape Hatteras and 68 degrees W, is fed by inflow from the northern side of the Gulf Stream and that this inflow is concentrated near Cape Hatteras and 68 degrees W, where the Gulf Stream flows steeply across isobaths converging from the north.\\nC1 UNIV N CAROLINA, MARINE SCI PROGRAM, CHAPEL HILL, NC 27599 USA.\\n   UNIV RHODE ISL, GRAD SCH OCEANOG, NARRAGANSETT, RI 02882 USA.\\nRP JOHNS, WE (通讯作者)，UNIV MIAMI, ROSENSTIEL SCH MARINE & ATMOSPHER SCI, MIAMI, FL 33149 USA.\\nNR 34\\nTC 146\\nZ9 148\\nU1 2\\nU2 26\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

Project-provided corrections were accepted but are tested as part of the overall results. The ocean was treated as static over each 10-day repeat cycle and maps constructed of the absolute sea surface topography from simple averages in 2 degrees x 2 degrees bins. A hybrid geoid model formed from a combination of the recent Joint Gravity Model-2 and the project-provided Ohio State University geoid was used to estimate the absolute topography in each 10-day period. Results are examined in terms of the annual average, seasonal variations, and variations near the repeat period. Conclusions are as follows: the orbit error is now difficult to observe, having been reduced to a level at or below the level of other error sources; the geoid dominates the error budget of the estimates of the absolute topography; the estimated seasonal cycle is consistent with prior estimates; shorter-period variability is dominated on the largest scales by an oxcillation near 50 days in spherical harmonics Y-1(m)(theta, lambda) with an amplitude near 10 cm, close to the simplest alias of the M(2) tide. This spectral peak and others visible in the periodograms support the hypothesis that the largest remaining time-dependent errors lie in the tidal models. Though discrepancies attributable to the geoid are within the formal uncertainties of the geoid estimates, removal of them is urgent for circulation studies. Current gross accuracy of the TOPEX/POSEIDON mission is in the range of 5-10 cm, distributed over a broad band of frequencies and wavenumbers. In finite bands, accuracies approach the l-cm level, and expected improvements arising from extended mission duration should reduce these numbers by nearly an order of magnitude.\\nRP STAMMER, D (通讯作者)，MIT, DEPT EARTH ATMOSPHER & PLANETARY SCI, 54-1518, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA.\\nNR 48\\nTC 67\\nZ9 67\\nU1 1\\nU2 3\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

During this short period, the energy of the near-inertial wave decreased by 70%. The shear layers produced by the wave were regions of enhanced turbulent dissipation rates. The authors estimate that 44% of the observed change in the near-inertial energy was lost to turbulence. Estimates of the wave energy lost at the survey site due to the wave propagating out of the region were smaller. Energy lost by horizontal advection of the wave out of the survey region was more difficult to estimate; the horizontal extent of the near-inertial energy was unknown. Advection could account for more than half of the observed energy lost. However, the authors did not detect the near-inertial wave during a 40 km X 40 km ADCP survey after completing the six-day station.\\nC1 OREGON STATE UNIV,COLL OCEAN & ATMOSPHER SCI,CORVALLIS,OR.\\nRP HEBERT, D (通讯作者)，UNIV RHODE ISL,GRAD SCH OCEANOG,NARRAGANSETT,RI 02882, USA.\\nRI Moum, James N/N-1187-2019; Moum, James N/A-1880-2012\\nNR 32\\nTC 47\\nZ9 49\\nU1 0\\nU2 6\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693\\nSN 0022-3670\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

The chemical properties of these two lenslike masses of water were described by Baker et al. (1989) and clearly indicate that they were generated by massive and rapid ventings of hot hydrothermal fluid from the ridge. Both are nearly circular with radii of about 6.5 km. The isopycnals bow upward around these cores of anomalous water, leading to an anticyclonic circulation. A cyclogeostrophic balance gives maximum currents at the edge of the core of 0.11 m s-1 for the first megaplume (MP1) and 0.07m s-1 for the second megaplume (MP2). Currents extend beyond the core to a radius of 12-15 km. The centers of the cores are in nearly solid body rotation with relative vorticities of -0.5f (MP1) and -0.3f (MP2) and potential vorticity anomalies, expressed in units of equivalent relative vorticity, of -0.8f (MP1) and -0.6f (MP2), where f is the Coriolis frequency. The aspect ratio of each megaplume gives a Burger number of 0.22. In terms of these nondimensional numbers, the megaplumes are very similar to eddies of Mediterranean water found in the eastern Atlantic (meddies), despite their very different origin.\\nC1 NOAA, PACIFIC MARINE ENVIRONM LAB, SEATTLE, WA 98115 USA.\\nRP DASARO, E (通讯作者)，UNIV WASHINGTON, COLL OCEAN & FISHERY SCI, APPL PHYS LAB, 1013 NE 40TH ST, SEATTLE, WA 98105 USA.\\nRI Baker, Edward/C-7688-2015\\nOI Baker, Edward/0000-0002-8794-4180\\nNR 24\\nTC 18\\nZ9 18\\nU1 0\\nU2 5\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

Massive fluidization failure is consistently observed following internal resonance events inside the silt bed. The weakening effect of this resonance is observed to endure long periods of consolidation. A wave reloading, following such a consolidation period, on a preresonated soil usually results in a recurrence of a similarly massive fluidization failure. Analysis of pore pressure records indicates that the resonance events are localized in space and the associated wave modes are short in wavelengths. It is proposed that these resonant events are a consequence of a strong channeling of the seepage flow within the silt bed.\\nRP FODA, MA (通讯作者)，UNIV CALIF BERKELEY, DEPT CIVIL ENGN, BERKELEY, CA 94720 USA.\\nNR 15\\nTC 58\\nZ9 67\\nU1 0\\nU2 7\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

The associated colonization, physiological adaptation, and growth of sea ice biota within these structures, to the levels presently identifiable, are also reviewed. A strong interaction exists between the physical processes that form, evolve and deteriorate sea ice, and the biological communities located within sea ice. Variability of ice structure and associated biological communities over small spatial scales necessitated analysis of the biological component in combination with physical and chemical properties of the sea ice. The ice microstructure provides indications of the growth and evolution of the ice properties and initially defines how ice biota colonize the ice. The light, temperature,space and nutrient fields within which ice biota subsequently adapt and grow, are the other key determinants of the biology. While the ice microstructure shapes the localized biological response; relatively large regions of pack ice have characteristic microstructures. Regional patterns of biomass and biological productivity within the Antarctic sea ice zone may therefore be predictable as a result of these physical-biological associations. Examples from the drifting pack ice and fast ice zones of the Weddell and Ross Seas are given.\\nC1 UNIV SO CALIF,DEPT BIOL SCI,LOS ANGELES,CA 90089.\\nRP ACKLEY, SF (通讯作者)，USA,COLD REG RES & ENGN LAB,72 LYME RD,HANOVER,NH 03755, USA.\\nNR 83\\nTC 172\\nZ9 178\\nU1 0\\nU2 38\\nPU PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD\\nPI OXFORD\\nPA THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB\\nSN 0967-0637\\nJ9 DEEP-SEA RES PT I\\nJI Deep-Sea Res.

Data are assimilated during one year and north of 20-degrees-S. The model-data misfit is minimized using the adjoint model with respect to the initial conditions and the reference surface.\\n   The assimilation algorithm converges fast and steadily. The monthly rms difference between model and data is reduced from 21 to 16 m. The optimal thermocline surface is significantly affected by assimilation. Large changes occur along the paths of the through flow and South Equatorial Current. It is found that the optimal mean state is valid only for the period of assimilation. It degrades the agreement between observations and simulations for the following year because of the large interannual event that took place over 1986-1988.\\n   With an assumed 7-cm observation error, model and data are overall consistent.  But the model is fundamentally inconsistent with data in the Bay of Bengal or in the Indonesian Through flow region.

In combination with meteorological and wave data from the National Data Buoy Center Buoy 46013, these measurements provide information about the physical forcing and resultant resuspension and transport of bottom material between 21 November and 8 March. Sixteen events were identified in the wave, wind and current-meter records for this period. Only two were local storms with southerly winds, but they caused about half of the seasonal net transport. Seven were swell events that combined long-period waves generated by distant storms with local currents. At the 90-m site, swells interacted with the mean northward flow to produce northward transport. During six northerly wind events, upwelling-favorable winds often were sufficient to slow or reverse the mean northward flow and thus caused southward transport. A single current event, which produced moderate southward transport, was observed at the 130-m site. Net transport during the winter experiment was offshore at all sites, northward at the inner- and mid-shelf sites, but southward at the outer-shelf site. The results suggest that local storms with southerly winds may dominate seasonal transport, as on the Washington shelf, but significant transport also can occur during fair weather and during periods of northerly winds.\\nC1 US GEOL SURVEY,WOODS HOLE,MA 02543.\\n   US GEOL SURVEY,MENLO PK,CA 94025.\\n   UNIV VIRGINIA,CHARLOTTESVILLE,VA 22903.\\n   WOODS HOLE OCEANOG INST,WOODS HOLE,MA 02543.\\n   BATTELLE MEM INST,MARINE SCI LAB,SEQUIM,WA 98382.\\n   SKIDAWAY INST OCEANOG,SAVANNAH,GA 31416.\\nRP SHERWOOD, CR (通讯作者)，UNIV WASHINGTON,SCH OCEANOG,SEATTLE,WA 98195, USA.\\nNR 50\\nTC 96\\nZ9 100\\nU1 0\\nU2 7\\nPU PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD\\nPI OXFORD\\nPA THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB\\nSN 0278-4343\\nJ9 CONT SHELF RES\\nJI Cont.

The tests involve the barotropic and baroclinic response of a coastal ocean with a uniform alongshore shelf to the passage of a storm and the circulation induced by flow over a topographic feature. The model used in this study is the estuarine, coastal, and ocean model developed by Blumberg and Mellor. The model is three dimensional and solves for three components of the current field, temperature, and salinity. The model has a terrain-following sigma (sigma) coordinate system, a coastal-following curvilinear grid in the horizontal, and an embedded second-order turbulence closure submodel to provide vertical mixing coefficients and uses the free surface as a prognostic variable. At the open boundaries, a flow relaxation scheme (FRS) has been implemented to pass out internally generated disturbances with minimum reflection. The results from the first test case demonstrate that the model successfully reproduces the expected theoretical response to a traveling storm. Both standing and propagating shelf waves with the proper spatial structure are found. In the upper part of the ocean, wind-generated oscillations are the dominant response. In the second test case, a stationary anticyclone forms over the topographic feature and a cyclonic eddy is shed downstream in a time of the order of the advective timescale, in agreement with theory and previous studies. When investigating the long-term evolution, the model simulations reproduce the baroclinic instability mechanisms expected from analytical considerations.\\nC1 NORWEGIAN METEOROL INST, OSLO, NORWAY.\\n   HYDROQUAL INC, MAHWAH, NJ USA.\\nRP SLORDAL, LH (通讯作者)，UNIV OSLO, INST GEOPHYS, POB 1022, N-0315 OSLO, NORWAY.\\nNR 30\\nTC 15\\nZ9 16\\nU1 0\\nU2 2\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA\\nSN 0022-3670\\nEI 1520-0485\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

In the western Pacific (140-degrees-W to 165-degrees-E) the westward South Equatorial Current is well established. Distributions of tracers show extrema near the equator in the eastern Pacific (from 95-degrees-W to 140 W), indicating that the upwelling is especially active in this area. The zonal distribution of chemical tracers is not regular because of intrusions of warmer water from the north associated with equatorial long waves. The temporal changes in PCO2 result from thermodynamic changes, biological activity, and gas exchange with the atmosphere. In order to compare the magnitude of these processes, we assess the variations of PCO2 (dPCO2) between two stations as the sum of thermodynamic changes driven by temperature and salinity changes, air-sea exchange computed from observed wind and difference of PCO2 between the sea and the atmosphere, and the biological activity estimated from the nitrate decrease and C:N ratio (106:16). The resulting assessed change in PCO2 is in agreement with the observed change for 42 pairs of stations. Each of these pairs of stations is thus considered as representing a simple water mass advected by the measured currents between the two stations so that daily fluxes can be estimated. The contribution of CO2 outgassing to dpCO2 is low, between -0.2 to -0.0 mu atm d-1. The thermodynamical dPCO2 averages 0.7 +/- 0.2 mu atm d-1 in the mixed layer. The biological dPCO2 (-1.5 +/- 0.5 mu atm d-1) is the highest in absolute value implying an average value of new production along the equator of 72 +/- 25 mmolC m-2 d-1 (0.9 +/- 0.3 gC m-2 d-1) for the equatorial Pacific (130-degrees-W-165-degrees-E). This value is very high and the overestimation could result from the simplistic description of the advection and mixing of water. An attempt to account for these processes by constraining the net heat flux to 100 W m-2 [Weare et al., 198 1] reduces the estimate of new production to 58 mmolC m-2 d-1 (0.7 gC m-2 d-1). A mean upwelling velocity of 0.5 +/- 0.1 m d-1 east of 140-degrees-W is calculated, based on F12 undersaturations.\\nC1 LAMONT DOHERTY EARTH OBSERV, PALISADES, NY 10964 USA.\\n   ORSTOM, INST FRANCAIS RECH SCI DEV COOPERAT, NOUMEA, NEW CALEDONIA.\\nRP LEFEVRE, N (通讯作者)，UNIV PARIS 06, ORSTOM, CNRS, OCEANOG DYNAM & CLIMATOL LAB, T 24 2EME ETAGE, F-75252 PARIS 05, FRANCE.\\nRI rodier, martine/M-2379-2014\\nOI rodier, martine/0000-0003-0339-7587; Lefevre,\\n   Nathalie/0000-0002-1126-5528\\nNR 42\\nTC 31\\nZ9 31\\nU1 0\\nU2 4\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

Larger areas were sampled over shorter periods of time than is possible with conventional surveys carried out by ships. The circulation of the eastern Mediterranean consists of a collection of subgyres and fronts which show surprising seasonal and interannual variability. These surveys help to describe further this variability which is only partially understood. In particular, the surveys provide additional evidence that a relatively strong anticyclone located adjacent to the southeast comer of Crete during the late summer and through fall is a consequence of strong north winds from the Aegean, the Etesians, being blocked by Crete. Also notable in both surveys was the absence of \\'\\'a\\'\\' strong Mersa-Matruh gyre, an anticyclone or anticyclonic subgyre off the Egyptian coast generally considered to be permanent. In contrast to published earlier observations, the Mersa Matruh gyre system was more a collection of weaker anticyclones rather than a single, sometimes double centered, strong feature. In both surveys we saw a string of anticyclones off the African coast between about 24-degrees and 32-degrees-E. In general, these eddies did not exhibit a significant surface thermal structure, but were most evident in the 200 m to 300 m-depth depictions. It may be that the formation of a strong southeast Crete anticyclone inhibits the formation of a large, relatively strong Mersa-Matruh subgyre by interacting with the mid-Mediterranean jet. If so, then both the southeast Crete anticyclone and the Mersa-Matruh anticyclone could both be recurrent but tend to occur at different times.\\nRP HORTON, C (通讯作者)，USN, OCEANOG OFF, BAY ST LOUIS, MS 39522 USA.\\nNR 15\\nTC 27\\nZ9 27\\nU1 0\\nU2 3\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

Since these emissions are driven by the surface seawater concentration of DMS, it is important to understand the processes controlling the cycling of sulfur in surface seawater. During the third Pacific Sulfur/Stratus Investigation (PSI-3, April 1991) we measured the major sulfur reservoirs (total organic sulfur, total low molecular weight organic sulfur, ester sulfate, protein sulfur, dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), DMS, dimethylsulfoxide) and quantified many of the processes that cycle sulfur through the upper water column (sulfate assimilation, DMSP consumption, DMS production and consumption, air-sea exchange of DMS, loss of organic sulfur by particulate sinking). Under conditions of low plankton biomass (<0.4 mug/L chlorophyll a) and high nutrient concentrations (>8 muM nitrate), 250 km off the Washington State coast, DMSP and DMS were 22% and 0.9%, respectively, of the total particulate organic sulfur pool. DMS production from the enzymatic cleavage of DMSP accounted for 29% of the total sulfate assimilation. However, only 0.3% of sulfate-S assimilated was released to the atmosphere. From these data it is evident that air-sea exchange is currently only a minor sink in the seawater sulfur cycle and thus there is the potential for much higher DMS emissions under different climatic conditions.\\nC1 DREXEL UNIV, DEPT CHEM, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19104 USA.\\n   UNIV WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE, CTR GREAT LAKES STUDIES, MILWAUKEE, WI 53204 USA.\\n   UNIV MIAMI, ROSENSTIEL SCH MARINE & ATMOSPHER SCI, MIAMI, FL 33149 USA.\\n   UNIV WASHINGTON, JOINT INST STUDY ATMOSPHERE & OCEAN, SEATTLE, WA 98195 USA.\\n   UNIV GEORGIA, INST MARINE, SAPELO ISL, GA USA.\\n   MONTEREY BAY AQUARIUM RES INST, PACIFIC GROVE, CA 93950 USA.\\nRP BATES, TS (通讯作者)，NOAA, PACIFIC MARINE ENVIRONM LAB, 7600 SAND POINT WAY NE, SEATTLE, WA 98115 USA.\\nRI Bates, Timothy S/L-6080-2016; Blomquist, Byron W./ABE-5387-2020\\nNR 56\\nTC 164\\nZ9 170\\nU1 4\\nU2 33\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

Except in the areas of anticyclonic eddies distributed around the periphery of the basin, the inshore portion of the Rim Current along the relatively smooth continental margin topography forms a narrow coastal jet characterized by small amplitude (approximately 20-30 km) undulations with a wavelength of approximately 125 km. The offshore margin of the Rim Current, however, exhibits large meanders, offshore filaments and dipole eddy structures. The Rim Current is accompanied by a strong frontal zone having cross-frontal temperature and salinity differences of approximately 1.0-degrees-C and approximately 0.5, respectively, near the surface. The circulation within the interior of the sea is composed of an interconnecting series of cyclonic eddies and gyres, varying in size and shape with depth. The mesoscale variability introduces a different scale of complexity to the general circulation at each pressure level, although larger and quasi-persistent features of the general circulation are fairly coherent down to 500 dbar. Important structural changes, however, take place in both large scale and mesoscale components of the circulation at 500 dbar and deeper, consistent with the findings of the September 1990 survey (OGUZ et al., Deep-Sea Research I, 40, 1597-1612). The circulation is strongest in the upper layer (approximately 150 dbar), where the calculated geostrophic currents have speeds of 0.2-0.3 ms-1 along the axis of the Rim Current. The strength, width, and frontal intensity of the Rim Current, however, reduce considerably below the permanent pycnocline.\\nC1 MARINE HYDROPHYS INST,SEVASTOPOL,UKRAINE.\\n   WOODS HOLE OCEANOG INST,WOODS HOLE,MA 02543.\\n   INST OCEANOL,VARNA,BULGARIA.\\n   ROMANIAN MARINE RES INST,CONSTANTA,ROMANIA.\\n   DOKUZ EYLUL UNIV,INST MARINE SCI & TECHNOL,IZMIR,TURKEY.\\nRP OGUZ, T (通讯作者)，MIDDLE E TECH UNIV,INST MARINE SCI,ERDEMLI,TURKEY.\\nRI Besiktepe, Sukru/L-2272-2013; Besiktepe, Sukru/AAA-5366-2021; Sur, Halil\\n   İbrahim/AAD-6014-2020; Duman, Muhammet/ABI-3995-2020; Duman,\\n   Muhammet/A-4462-2018; oguz, temel/J-4252-2017\\nOI Besiktepe, Sukru/0000-0002-9615-4746; Besiktepe,\\n   Sukru/0000-0002-9615-4746; Sur, Halil İbrahim/0000-0001-8999-0503;\\n   Duman, Muhammet/0000-0002-4771-9675; \\nNR 33\\nTC 74\\nZ9 81\\nU1 0\\nU2 8\\nPU PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD\\nPI OXFORD\\nPA THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB\\nSN 0967-0637\\nJ9 DEEP-SEA RES PT I\\nJI Deep-Sea Res.

This feature develops largely from photosynthetic oxygen production, and measurement of the rate of oxygen accumulation provides the basis to make an independent estimate of primary production. Net accumulation of dissolved oxygen represents new production, which is generally presumed to require a new nutrient input consisting of some form of preformed nutrients. Here the time scales, vertical distribution or properties and new nutrient sources associated with formation of the SOM in the North Pacific ocean are considered. The SOM forms on two distinct time scales, episodic and gradual, and apparently through different processes on each scale. The episodic SOM develops from physical events in which nutricline water is transported into the mixed layer and then ventilated to the atmosphere. This process results in the local creation of preformed nutrients that stimulate a phytoplankton bloom and a vertical maximum of chlorophyll and dissolved oxygen. However, the time scale of formation of the gradual SOM is inconsistent with this mechanism because repeated mixing and ventilation events cannot result in the gradual accumulation of oxygen. An alternative new nutrient source is required. It is hypothesized that the gradual SOM develops from an input of the \\'\\'new\\'\\' nutrients contained in organic matter transported from other depths by migrating animals and/or sinking particles. This hypothesis implies that the concept of new production must be carefully defined in context of the vertical structure of the euphotic zone. Whether or not my hypothesis is correct, these observations show that estimating primary production by measuring the increase in dissolved oxygen is very difficult. For both the episodic and gradual SOM, estimating production requires that the gas fluxes due to air-sea exchange and vertical and horizontal mixing be well known, in. addition to direct measurements of the temporal change in dissolved oxygen within a water parcel.\\nRP HAYWARD, TL (通讯作者)，UNIV CALIF SAN DIEGO,SCRIPPS INST OCEANOG,LA JOLLA,CA 92093, USA.\\nNR 44\\nTC 23\\nZ9 23\\nU1 0\\nU2 5\\nPU PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD\\nPI OXFORD\\nPA THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB\\nSN 0967-0637\\nJ9 DEEP-SEA RES PT I\\nJI Deep-Sea Res.

These synoptic pigment fields are compared with SST, wind, sea lever, and Orinoco River discharge series (1979-1982). The information helped outline the spatial extent of upwelling centers and their seasonal variability, and the influence of the Orinoco\\'s discharge on the margin of the southern Caribbean Sea.\\n   A seasonal SST cycle was observed throughout the Caribbean, with peaks between August and November (ca 29 degrees C), and minima between January and June (ca 25.5 degrees C). Waters within 100 km of the continent were consistently similar to 0.5 degrees C cooler. Along-shore wind stress intensified from November (ca -0.05 N m(-2)) to maxima in April-May (ca -0.10 N m(-2)), then weakened through June and July, and remained low (-0.04 to -0.07 N m(-2)) until November. Low-frequency (>26 h) filtered coastal sea level was usually below the mean (<-0.04 m) between January and April, near the mean between May and August, and then above the mean (>0.04 m) from September to November, The Orinoco discharged a mean 3.9 x 10(4) m(3) s(-1), ranging from 1 x 10(4) m(3) s(-1) in March to about 7 x 10(4) m(3) s(-1) in August.\\n   The data show an inverse relationship between pigment concentration and coastal sea level, and a direct relationship with zonal wind stress, both at seasonal time scales and at shorter event scales. The frequency and area of blooms was larger during periods of strong wind (January-April), and smaller during June-October. Mean pigment concentration was higher around Margarita (4 year mean of 1.2 mg m(-3)) than off. central Venezuela (4 year mean of 0.45 mg m(-3)), which indicated that more intense upwelling occurs near the former broad continental shelf, where the horizontal, cross-wind scare of coastal upwelling may be smaller than over a narrow shelf. Pigment concentrations were particularly high near capes and headlands.\\n   Concentrations off eastern/central Venezuela and the Orinoco\\'s flow were inversely related. In contrast, pigments near Tobago varied directly with discharge. During the first half of the year, the Orinoco plume was located between Trinidad and Tobago, and pigments around Tobago were low (<0.5 mg m(-3)). During July-November, the plume engulfed Tobago, Grenada and St Vincent, with values >1 mg m(-3). Interannual variation was evident in the series: sea level was unusually high (daily mean sea level up to 0.25 m) during the second half of 1979, and unusually low (daily mean as low as -0.20 m) in early 1980. The latter corresponded with extended periods of unusually strong trade winds and coincided with periods of extremely large patches of high pigments along the coast.\\nC1 UNIV ORIENTE,INST OCEANOG,CUMANA,VENEZUELA.\\nRP MULLERKARGER, FE (通讯作者)，UNIV S FLORIDA,DEPT MARINE SCI,ST PETERSBURG,FL 33701, USA.\\nNR 54\\nTC 79\\nZ9 83\\nU1 0\\nU2 7\\nPU PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD\\nPI OXFORD\\nPA THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB\\nSN 0278-4343\\nJ9 CONT SHELF RES\\nJI Cont.

Rates were highest on the continental margin, and declined precipitously offshore. On the middle continental slope, rates were almost as high as those on the continental shelf, supporting the idea that mid-slope depths al ca 1000 m depth are a \\'\\'depocenter\\'\\' for particulate organic debris.\\n   The sediment oxygen demand, in terms of carbon equivalents (mg C m(-2) day(-1)), was generally lower than near-bottom POC fluxes measured in sediment traps. This imbalance is attributed to a combination of burial, anaerobic metabolism not reflected in oxygen demand, and continued lateral export along or offshore near the bottom. The exception to this pattern was the mid-slope depocenter, where the measured POC input was slightly less than the total organic carbon demand estimated with the lander.\\n   A comparison with other work suggests that at most depths on the continental margin the sediment oxygen demand is higher off the west coast of the U.S.A. than off the east coast. The upper to middle continental slope (500-1500 m depth) is the only zone over which sediment oxygen demand is higher on the east coast, but this can be attributed to the physiological limitations of low ambient oxygen concentration on heterotrophic metabolism in the pronounced oxygen minimum on the west coast.\\nC1 NOAA,NATL MARINE FISHERIES SERV,SILVER SPRING,MD 20910.\\n   COLUMBIA UNIV,LAMONT DOHERTY GEOL OBSERV,PALISADES,NY 10964.\\nRP ROWE, GT (通讯作者)，TEXAS A&M UNIV,DEPT OCEANOG,COLLEGE STN,TX 77843, USA.\\nOI Anderson, Robert/0000-0002-8472-2494\\nNR 39\\nTC 67\\nZ9 69\\nU1 0\\nU2 6\\nPU PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD\\nPI OXFORD\\nPA THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB\\nSN 0967-0645\\nJ9 DEEP-SEA RES PT II\\nJI Deep-Sea Res.

In this paper we quantitatively compute what are the consequences of this assumption on the estimates of dispersion for some simple flows with oceanographical scales. We compare the analytical results of two different models, one with infinitesimal turbulent time scale (corresponding to a model with eddy-diffusion) and the other with finite scale T. The difference between the two model results normalized with respect to the estimate of the eddy-diffusion model, called DELTA, is computed and it is used as a measure of the accuracy of the eddy-diffusion parameterization. In the case of homogeneous turbulence, the eddy-diffusion model is accurate for asymptotic times t much greater than T, as is known, whereas for small times it is characterized by an overestimate of the dispersion. DELTA decreases asymptotically as T/t, with the overestimate less than 10% for t > 10T, so that the eddy-diffusion model is appropriate for the meso or global scales but it could be inadequate for short-term studies or for the interpretation of Lagrangian data. When a linear shear is superimposed on the turbulence, DELTA still decreases as similar-to T/t, which indicates that the range of applicability of the eddy-diffusion model is approximately the same for homogeneous and for linearly inhomogeneous flows. We then consider an oscillating linear shear with frequency omega, and the results change drastically. DELTA does not vanish asymptotically, but rather converges to an oscillating function with constant average and constant extrema. The values of DELTA depend on the ratio between the turbulent time scale T and the period of oscillation 1/omega. When T and 1/omega are comparable, the eddy-diffusion model leads to an overestimate of order one even at asymptotic times. This result is a specific and analytically solvable example of a potentially much wider class of results valid for time-dependent flows with more complex spatial structure. A discussion of the possible generalizations and examples of applications to oceanographical flows are presented.\\nC1 IST UNIV NAVALE,IST METEOROL & OCEANOG,NAPLES,ITALY.\\nRP ZAMBIANCHI, E (通讯作者)，UNIV MIAMI,ROSENSTIEL SCH MARINE & ATMOSPHER SCI,MIAMI,FL 33149, USA.\\nOI zambianchi, enrico/0000-0001-5474-7466\\nNR 24\\nTC 41\\nZ9 41\\nU1 0\\nU2 1\\nPU KLINE GEOLOGY LABORATORY\\nPI NEW HAVEN\\nPA YALE UNIV, NEW HAVEN, CT 06520\\nSN 0022-2402\\nJ9 J MAR RES\\nJI J.

To assess the impact of enhanced incident ultraviolet irradiance on this community, a knowledge of the amount of light transmitted through a sea ice cover is necessary. A two-stream radiative transfer model is used to estimate the penetration of ultraviolet radiation through Antarctic sea ice. Sea ice optical properties were used as proxies to infer scattering and absorption coefficients at ultraviolet wavelengths. Case studies are reported for sea ice in McMurdo Sound and in the Weddell Sea. Values of spectral transmittance are computed as well as integrated transmitted UV-B, UV-A, biologically effective irradiance (BEI), and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). UV-B light levels under meter-thick ice are a few percent of incident values. The presence of a snow cover results in a large decrease in transmitted ultraviolet. Snow and ice ameliorate the biological impact of enhanced levels of incident ultraviolet radiation by reducing the BEI relative to the PAR.\\nRP PEROVICH, DK (通讯作者)，USA, COLD REG RES & ENGN LAB, 72 LYME RD, HANOVER, NH 03755 USA.\\nNR 43\\nTC 39\\nZ9 39\\nU1 1\\nU2 11\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

The reference method is a simple average of fluxes computed from hourly values of bulk meteorological parameters termed the sampling method (SM). In contrast, the scaler averaging method (SAM) computes the average flux from the average of the bulk data; thus it ignores correlations between variables. The vector averaging method (VAM) is similar to the SAM but uses the magnitude of the average wind vector father than the average magnitude of die hourly wind vectors. The data used in this study were collected during the Tropical Ocean and Global Atmospheric pilot cruise of the R/V Wecoma in the equatorial Pacific Ocean near 0-degrees-N, 145-degrees-E from February 17 to March 10, 1990. The ratios of the SAM and VAM values relative to the SM values were studied as a function of averaging periods from 2-72 hours. The ratios vary little for times exceeding 36 hours. For averaging periods of 72 hours, the SAM estimates of Q(E), Q(H), tau(x), and tau(y) were 102%, 61%, 21%, and 69% of the SM estimates, respectively; the VAM ratios were even lower. These results suggest that air-sea surface scaler fluxes and stress components computed from monthly, weekly, and even daily averaged bulk meteorological parameters can be seriously in error in equatorial, temporally variable wind regimes.\\nC1 PENN STATE UNIV, DEPT METEOROL, UNIV PK, PA 16802 USA.\\n   NOAA, WAVE PROPAGAT LAB, BOULDER, CO 80303 USA.\\nRP LEDVINA, DV (通讯作者)，GEN SCI CORP, LAUREL, MD 20707 USA.\\nRI fairall, christopher/G-5970-2019\\nOI fairall, christopher/0000-0003-4073-7413\\nNR 21\\nTC 27\\nZ9 32\\nU1 0\\nU2 3\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

In the eastern subpolar North Pacific the tritium gradient between surface water and North Pacific Intermediate Water is smallest during years that coincide with El Nino events. In the eastern subtropical North Pacific between 200 and 400 m the tritium signature suggests that the water is of subpolar origin during non-El Nino years. During El Nino years, the water at this location is devoid of tritium. We hypothesize that the El Nino phenomenon alters both the ventilation of thermocline and intermediate waters in the eastern subpolar North Pacific, as well as the transport of this water to the eastern subtropical gyre. Combined with satellite altimeter data, these results offer both a mechanism and a time frame by which subpolar water ventilates the vast reservoir of the subtropical North Pacific.\\nC1 UNIV CALIF IRVINE, DEPT GEOSCI, IRVINE, CA 92717 USA.\\n   WOODS HOLE OCEANOG INST, DEPT MARINE CHEM & GEOCHEM, WOODS HOLE, MA 02543 USA.\\nRP VANSCOY, KA (通讯作者)，PLYMOUTH MARINE LAB, PROSPECT PL, PLYMOUTH PL1 3DH, ENGLAND.\\nNR 35\\nTC 28\\nZ9 28\\nU1 0\\nU2 1\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

Better agreement was found along the westernmost ground track; pressure sensor noise is the probable source of the larger errors along the easternmost ground track.

Uncorrelated errors dominate, but along the westernmost ground track, IES/PG-derived sea surface height variability is systematically smaller than that derived from Geosat data; this factor, determined by regression analysis, is about 0.81.

The excited waves are those with phase speeds that match the zonal translation speed of a wind burst, typically 10 m s-1. These modes sum to produce oscillations near the local inertial frequency at each latitude, analogous to near-inertial internal gravity waves generated by moving storms at midlatitude. Linear theory predicts that typical wind burst amplitudes (stresses of 0.1 Pa) will generate substantial current oscillations [O (1 m s-1)] in the upper ocean. Response is initially confined to the region directly beneath a wind burst, after which the wake descends and refracts equatorward as a propagating beam. Waves are of sufficient amplitude to dominate shear and vertical strain in the upper ocean. Phase differences between oscillations at neighboring latitudes induce motion in the meridional-vertical plane at ever-decreasing meridional scales. Mixing associated with predicted low Richardson numbers is expected to check development of nonlinearity from vertical and meridional advection by the waves.\\nC1 UNIV WASHINGTON,SCH OCEANOG,SEATTLE,WA 98195.\\nNR 21\\nTC 19\\nZ9 19\\nU1 0\\nU2 0\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693\\nSN 0022-3670\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

Stommel proposed to close this circulation by adding the western boundary currents. Here, a first-order description of the Goldsbrough-Stommel circulation for the world oceans is presented, using available climatologies. While such flows are an order of magnitude smaller than the wind-driven circulation, the interaction between the Goldsbrough-Stommel gyres and the wind-driven and thermally driven circulation determines the salinity distribution of the world oceans. Therefore, it is important to study the Goldsbrough-Stommel circulation and its interaction with motions driven by other forcings. In addition, the western boundary currents required to close the Goldsbrough interior and to satisfy interbasin mass transport can be substantial. In the Atlantic the southward western boundary current reaches two Sverdrups (Sv = 10(6) m3 s-1) at 35-degrees-N. It is suggested that this adverse current causes a southward shift in the separation point of the Gulf Stream; a simple model indicates that the displacement is about 75 km.\\nRP HUANG, RX (通讯作者)，WOODS HOLE OCEANOG INST,DEPT PHYS OCEANOG,WOODS HOLE,MA 02543, USA.\\nRI Schmitt, Raymond W/B-7451-2011\\nNR 14\\nTC 30\\nZ9 31\\nU1 0\\nU2 5\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693\\nSN 0022-3670\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

The three moorings used in this calculation defined a triangle with base of 19 km and height of 28 km, and were densely instrumented from the surface to 160-m depth. Empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) are employed to identify components of current and temperature variability with scales that are resolved by the observations. A least squares fit to the EOF-filtered data is used to derive maps of velocity and temperature. The temperature field is dominated by the passage of fronts, with the highest variability at 160 m. Horizontal temperature gradients at 160 m peak at values approaching 1 x 10(-4) degrees-C m-1 and are indicative of a tilting of the seasonal thermocline. Velocities are directed primarily along isotherms and are swifter at the surface than at depth. The heat budget of the upper 160 m, for periods longer than 48 hours, is essentially a balance between rate of change of heat and horizontal advection; the correlation between these terms is 0.7. A simple explanation is the northward advection by a mean current of a series of fronts. The effect of surface heating becomes apparent in the upper 40 m, notably at the diurnal frequency and its first harmonic. An imbalance in the mean (102 days) heat budget can be rectified by a mean downwelling velocity of 5 x 10(-5) m s-1 at 160 m.\\nC1 WOODS HOLE OCEANOG INST, WOODS HOLE, MA 02543 USA.\\nRP RUDNICK, DL (通讯作者)，UNIV WASHINGTON, SCH OCEANOG, SEATTLE, WA 98195 USA.\\nRI Rudnick, Daniel L/J-8948-2016\\nOI Rudnick, Daniel L/0000-0002-2624-7074\\nNR 20\\nTC 13\\nZ9 13\\nU1 0\\nU2 2\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

Upwelling and northward detrainment of Gulf Stream water occur upstream of the meander crest (trailing flank) while downwelling and entrainment of Slope Water into the Gulf Stream occur downstream of the meander crest (leading flank). Two mesoscale zooplankton surveys of a Gulf Stream meander were conducted in autumn 1988 as part of the BIOSYNOP program to identify cross-stream trends and meander-associated changes in species abundances. The abundances of eight selected copepod species (five Sargasso Sea species, two Slope Water species and one widespread species) were enumerated from samples taken along three transects at different locations along the meander. The integrated abundances (0-1000 m) of seven of the selected species support the hypothesized entrainment and detrainment. Sargasso Sea species were more abundant across the upwelling flank than across the downwelling flank, whereas the opposite was true for Slope Water species. Species abundances on a trailing flank transect (upstream of the upwelling region) demonstrate effective transport of Sargasso Sea/Gulf Stream species out of the current into the Slope Water. The relative proportions of two copepod species (Pleuromamma borealis and P. gracilis) were sensitive to the processes of entrainment and detrainment in the meander, suggesting that these two species are useful indicator species of their respective water masses.

The hindcast experiment is analyzed to explore the processes that caused the large accelerations, decelerations, and thermal changes observed during this time. Several hindcast experiments incorporating variations of the SADLER wind field and several idealized experiments incorporating a western Pacific westerly wind event are analyzed and compared with the 1982-1983 SADLER hindcast to explore the importance of local and remote forcing, the relative importance of zonal and meridional wind stress changes, and the dynamical signatures of the processes at work. Meridional wind stress changes have little effect on either the zonal velocity or temperature fields. Local zonal wind stress variations can account for the qualitative changes in the upper-ocean zonal flow, but cannot reproduce the observed thermal changes or the timing and quantitative evolution of the zonal flow. Remote forcing is needed to account for these latter aspects of the observations. Eastward-propagating Kelvin response appears to be quite important, but westward-propagating Rossby variance forced during 1982 from east of 160-degrees-W does not appear to play any significant role. The idealized remote-forcing experiments indicate that westerly events can account for the variability not explained by local forcing; the essential aspect is how the forcing projects onto the vertical modes defined by the stratification under the forcing at the time of the wind event. Modes higher than the first and second can be strongly forced and the sum over modes produces vertical structures in the near field of the forcing similar to those observed. Simple linear Kelvin mode ideas thus are useful for understanding the response to remotely forced variability. However, nonlinear processes affect the quantitative response, both by changing the stratification under the forcing region as the forcing event proceeds (and thereby altering the modal projection of the forcing) and through zonal advection and interaction between the response and the background mean flow. The dynamical balance of terms for zonal momentum in the SADLER hindcast is quite complex and the difficulty of identifying remote forcing from the balance of terms, even during periods when remote forcing is the primary agent of change, is discussed. This detailed study of a particularly interesting period of equatorial flow and thermal variability illustrates the many processes at work on the equator in the central Pacific during periods of substantial local and remote wind stress variability. It also illustrates some of the challenges that might be encountered in interpreting the results of an oceanic local dynamics experiment under conditions like these.\\nC1 UNIV WASHINGTON,SCH OCEANOG,SEATTLE,WA 98195.\\nRP HARRISON, DE (通讯作者)，NOAA,PACIFIC MARINE ENVIRONM LAB,R,E,PM,BLDG 3,BIN C15700,SEATTLE,WA 98115, USA.\\nRI Harrison, Don/D-9582-2013\\nNR 23\\nTC 13\\nZ9 13\\nU1 0\\nU2 0\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693\\nSN 0022-3670\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

The Kuroshio volume transport (KVT) is estimated by integration over each transect of the downstream (positive) part of the geostrophic velocity referenced to the observed surface current. Our analysis indicates that, on average, only about 25% of the KVT inside the East China Sea is due to the baroclinic or vertically varying component. While KVT exhibits a small-scale temporal and spatial variability with downstream phase speeds of order 8-19 km day-1 and wavelengths of order 150-375 km, mean KVT is spatially uniform within the East China Sea. KVT has significant annual and interannual variations: KVT is large in summer, is positively correlated with local downstream wind stress, and is large during large meander events of the Kuroshio south of Japan. Our best estimate of the mean KVT in the East China Sea during 1986-1988 is 23.7 Sv +/- 2.0 Sv. This represents about one-half of the mean interior Sverdrup transport at this latitude. The Kuroshio quickly absorbs most of the remaining interior Sverdrup transport after it exits the East China Sea through the Tokara Strait.\\nC1 WOODS HOLE OCEANOG INST,DEPT PHYS OCEANOG,WOODS HOLE,MA 02543.\\nRP ICHIKAWA, H (通讯作者)，KAGOSHIMA UNIV,FAC FISHERIES,4-50-20 SHIMOARATA,KAGOSHIMA 890,JAPAN.\\nRI Ichikawa, Hiroshi/A-9523-2010\\nOI Ichikawa, Hiroshi/0000-0001-6576-0455\\nNR 19\\nTC 110\\nZ9 124\\nU1 0\\nU2 17\\nPU PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD\\nPI OXFORD\\nPA THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB\\nSN 0967-0637\\nJ9 DEEP-SEA RES PT I\\nJI Deep-Sea Res.

Principal conceptual themes that were addressed by the program included (1) the characterization of the role of dissolved organic matter as the main chromophore initiating photoprocesses in surface seawater, (2) the determination of the fluxes and pathways of reactants and transient species involved in oxygen photoredox chemistry, and (3) the continuing development of chemical mapping strategies, including observing and modelling reactive phototransient distribution in terms of their sources, mixing, and fates. Ancillary supporting studies included observation of water mass tracers, dissolved trace gases, atmospheric components, nutrients and the geochemistry of estuarine mixing processes in an important continental margin. The observational and mechanistic investigations reported here feature a number of novel or improved methods allied with some advanced underway sampling, sensing and computing facilities that were implemented aboard the R/V Columbus Iselin. Results from the study showed large-scale (approximately 1000 km) seasonal variations in surface water photoreactivity, optical and biooptical characteristics over much of the Caribbean basin. These changes resulted from seasonally varying riverine inputs of organic chromophores, nutrients and suspended material. Smaller scale (10-100 km) studies carried out in the Orinoco delta and the Gulf of Paria showed that estuarine mixing processes did not affect major net removal of dissolved organic matter, consistent with the hypothesis that riverine chromophore input plays a dominant role in open-water photochemistry.\\nC1 UNIV MIAMI, ROSENSTIEL SCH MARINE & ATMOSPHER SCI, 4600 RICKENBACKER CAUSEWAY, MIAMI, FL 33149 USA.\\n   WOODS HOLE OCEANOG INST, WOODS HOLE, MA 02543 USA.\\nNR 56\\nTC 28\\nZ9 28\\nU1 0\\nU2 3\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

The advance of ice cover, local melting of sea ice and advection of water masses, possibly from lower latitude regions, were the main sources of variability in the physical regime of the ice-edge zone. Analysis of the plankton assemblage showed phytoplankton biomass (PPC) in the upper 100 m ranging from 100 to 272 mg C m-2 and protozooplankton biomass (PZC) ranging from 177 to 410 mg C m-2. Autotrophic dinoflagellates dominated phytoplankton stocks, followed by other autotrophic nanoflagellates and diatoms in decreasing biomass. Heterotrophic flagellates dominated protozooplankton biomass followed by ciliates and sarcodines. The biomass of major groups comprising the planktonic assemblage was similar at most stations with the exception of one station where diatoms predominated. Integrated PPC and PZC showed no relationship to water column stability. Integrated autotrophic flagellate biomass was higher at open water stations than at ice-covered stations, but none of the other integrated group biomasses showed variations that could be related to ice cover or water mass characteristics. Analysis of discrete-depth samples indicated that all groups (except the sarcodines) showed near surface maxima, that total PPC, diatoms and autotrophic flagellates showed higher biomasses at ice-edge and open water stations than at ice-covered stations and that none of the heterotrophs showed variations related to ice cover. Some groups, however, showed differences that could be related to water mass characteristics, but this was less evident than was the effect of depth or ice cover. Comparison of species assemblages of diatoms and choanoflagellates among water column stations indicated variations that could be related to the differing cruise legs and water mass characteristics. Similar diatom assemblages were found in both ice and water, but higher concentrations occurred in the ice assemblages. A few diatom species were found to be indicator species for ice versus water assemblages and to distinguish among the varying hydrographic regimes.\\n   Although phytoplankton stocks were higher at non ice-covered than at ice-covered stations, we were not able to see distinct differences between ice-edge stations and those north of the furthest ice extent. We hypothesize that advection of sea ice into water above the freezing point and subsequent melting of ice probably affected much of our study area, so that any effects of \\'\\'enhanced production\\'\\' in the ice-edge zone would have been difficult to resolve. Moreover, absolute primary production was very low, and based on the trophic composition of the planktonic assemblage and production estimates from OUT AMERIEZ colleagues, we concluded that neither algal nor bacterial production was sufficient to produce an enrichment of protozooplankton stocks in the ice-edge zone. Calculations of a carbon budget suggested bacterial production was a significant proportion of total production and that the nano- and microheterotrophs must predominate in the utilization of both phyto- and bacterioplankton production at the winter ice edge. An analysis of species assemblages suggested little advection of populations from lower latitude regions and supports the contention that material was apparently released from sea ice during localized melting events. This input of carbon biomass and detritus from ice may supply the carbon needed to support the high concentrations of heterotrophs observed in our study, but this interpretation is confounded because ice-edge heterotrophic plankton populations also may be enriched by seeding from sea ice.\\nC1 MONTEREY BAY AQUARIUM RES INST,PACIFIC GROVE,CA 93950.\\nRP GARRISON, DL (通讯作者)，UNIV CALIF SANTA CRUZ,INST MARINE SCI,SANTA CRUZ,CA 95064, USA.\\nNR 64\\nTC 65\\nZ9 66\\nU1 0\\nU2 17\\nPU PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD\\nPI OXFORD\\nPA THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB\\nSN 0967-0637\\nJ9 DEEP-SEA RES PT I\\nJI Deep-Sea Res.

In addition, complementary meteorological data, sea surface height (Geosat) and sea surface temperature maps, and expendable bathythermograph (XBT) and shipboard profile data (physical and bio-optical) have been utilized for interpretation. The observations during March are characteristic of late wintertime conditions of a deep isothermal layer (approximately 18-19-degrees-C), but with intervening periods of warming due to the advection of warm outbreak waters associated with Gulf Stream meanders. The mixed layer depth shoals from greater than 160 m to about 25 m in late March (spring transition). Phytoplankton blooms follow the mixed layer shoaling. A succession of phytoplankton populations occurs during this transitional interval. Mesoscale variability associated with cold core rings and warm outbreak waters associated with the Gulf Stream are evident at various times. The mixed layer remains near 25 m for the summer and deepens in mid-September. A relatively intense subsurface maximum in chlorophyll develops at approximately 75 m following the spring transition. The maximum persists, but weakens in mid-summer. The present study clearly indicates that important processes associated with, and contributing to the seasonal cycle occur on short time and space scales and that integrated data sets obtained from moorings, ships, and satellites can be used to effectively study bio-optical and physical phenomena on tome scales from minutes to seasons.\\nC1 COLUMBIA UNIV, LAMONT DOHERTY GEOL OBSERV, PALISADES, NY 10964 USA.\\n   JET PROP LAB, PASADENA, CA 91109 USA.\\n   UNIV HAWAII, DEPT OCEANOG, HONOLULU, HI 96882 USA.\\n   UNIV CALIF SANTA BARBARA, CTR REMOTE SENSING & ENVIRONM OPT, SANTA BARBARA, CA 93106 USA.\\nRP DICKEY, T (通讯作者)，UNIV SO CALIF, DEPT GEOL SCI, OCEAN PHYS GRP, LOS ANGELES, CA 90089 USA.\\nRI Siegel, David A/C-5587-2008; Langdon, Chris/A-1543-2016\\nOI Langdon, Chris/0000-0002-3043-3806\\nNR 88\\nTC 54\\nZ9 54\\nU1 0\\nU2 3\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

Sampling was conducted in 1989 and 1990 in the vicinity of 47-49-degrees-N and 18-19-degrees-W as part of the JGOFS and BOFS studies of spring blooms in oceanic waters. Two size classes of dinoflagellates were distinguished: <20 mum cells, measured and enumerated using a sophisticated true-color image analysis system, and >20 mum cells, quantified via Utermohl microscopy.\\n   Dinoflagellates were an abundant component of the microzooplankton assemblages in the upper 200 m. In 1989, abundance ranged from 2 to 67 cells ml-1, equivalent to 0.1-3.5 mugC l-1. Heterotrophic dinoflagellates were more abundant in 1990, with 13-414 cells ml-1, equivalent to 0.9-18.3 mugC l-1. Nanodinoflagellates (<20 mum cells) dominated the assemblages, representing 99% of total numbers and 70-88% of total carbon biomass of heterotrophic dinoflagellates. The average carbon content of <20 mum cells was 32 pgC (1990) to 51 pgC (1989), compared with 1.5 ngC (1990) to 1.7 ngC (1989) for >20 mum cells. Estimates of their grazing impact, derived from literature data on growth rates and conversion efficiencies, ranged from 8 (1989) to 25% (1990) of total primary production, and up to 52% of <5 mum primary production. It is hypothesized that their greatest impact may occur beneath the mixed layer.\\nC1 HORN POINT ENVIRONM LABS,CAMBRIDGE,MD 21613.\\n   BIGELOW LAB OCEAN SCI,BOOTHBAY HARBOR,ME 04575.\\n   PLYMOUTH MARINE LAB,PLYMOUTH PL1 3DH,ENGLAND.\\nRP VERITY, PG (通讯作者)，SKIDAWAY INST OCEANOG,POB 13687,SAVANNAH,GA 31416, USA.\\nRI stoecker, diane k/F-9341-2013\\nOI Fileman, Elaine/0000-0002-7795-7535\\nNR 32\\nTC 73\\nZ9 76\\nU1 1\\nU2 12\\nPU PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD\\nPI OXFORD\\nPA THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB\\nSN 0967-0645\\nJ9 DEEP-SEA RES PT II\\nJI Deep-Sea Res.

The GEOSAT has a repeat path time of 17 days, and inferred near-surface flow features with periods of 34 days or less should not be detectable. Thus the current meter record was filtered with a 34 day low pass filter. Since only fluctuating flows can be inferred with the GEOSAT altimeter data, the deep recorded mean current was added to the satellite-inferred flow for comparison purposes.

Results from 26 in situ experiments and 9 simulated in situ experiments yielded production rates that were significantly higher than measured during the earlier Canadian Weather Station program. The new estimate of annual primary production is ca 170g C m-2y-1, over three times greater than previously thought. Maximum production rates of over 1g C m-2d-1 also exceeded recent measurements made with ultraclean sampling technique. Photosynthesis versus irradiance experiments yielded average light-saturated chlorophyll-specific assimilation rates of ca. 60mgC mgChl-1d-1, which, when combined with local estimates of algal C/Chl, suggested that the specific growth rate of phytoplankton exceeded one doubling per day under optimum conditions of irradiance. Although no spring phytoplankton blooms have ever been observed in the offshore subarctic Pacific, the primary production rates in this region are among the highest reported in any open-ocean environment; production per unit biomass does not seem limited to any extent. Removal processes, such as grazing and sinking, must necessarily play a major role in controlling the standing crop of phytoplankton in the subarctic Pacific.\\nC1 MONTEREY BAY AQUARIUM RES INST, PACIFIC GROVE, CA 93950 USA.\\n   WESTERN WASHINGTON UNIV, SHANNON POINT MARINE CTR, ANACORTES, WA 98221 USA.\\n   WOODS HOLE OCEANOG INST, DEPT CHEM, WOODS HOLE, MA 02543 USA.\\n   UNIV TENNESSEE, DEPT ECOL, KNOXVILLE, TN 37996 USA.\\n   UNIV CALIF BERKELEY, DEPT IMMUNOL, BERKELEY, CA 94720 USA.\\n   UNIV WASHINGTON, SCH OCEANOG, SEATTLE, WA 98195 USA.\\nRP WELSCHMEYER, NA (通讯作者)，MOSS LANDING MARINE LABS, MOSS LANDING, CA 95039 USA.\\nNR 51\\nTC 95\\nZ9 97\\nU1 0\\nU2 10\\nPU PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD\\nPI OXFORD\\nPA THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND\\nSN 0079-6611\\nJ9 PROG OCEANOGR\\nJI Prog.

These observed variations are compared with numerical simulations from a reduced-gravity model forced by observed winds over the same period. The first complex empirical orthogonal function of observed and simulated variations is an annual signal. For this signal, observations and simulations are highly correlated in both time and space. Off-equatorial sea level variations propagate westward and poleward as Rossby waves. The strongest annual variations occur in the southeastern tropical Indian Ocean. The maximum amplitude (approximately 12 cm) is located at about 90-degrees-E, 12-degrees-S, although the wind stress curl is weak there and east of it.

The first is the possible existence of local minima of the cost function, which prevents convergence of the optimization to the global minimum representing the desired optimal solution for the model inputs. The second difficulty, which seems the dominant one for many of the problems examined in this part as well as in Part I, is the ill conditioning of the inverse problem. Simple model equations are used to analyze the conditioning of the optimization problem and to analyze the role of both dissipation and waves in the model dynamics in conditioning the problem. The analysis suggests what might be an improved formulation of the cost function resulting in better conditioning of th e problem.\\n   The relation between the optimization approach and the robust diagnostic method of Sarmiento and Bryan is explicitly demonstrated, and the solution obtained by combining the two methods is used to examine the performance of the GCM used here for the North Atlantic Ocean.\\nC1 WEIZMANN INST SCI,DEPT ENVIRONM SCI & ENERGY RES,IL-76100 REHOVOT,ISRAEL.\\n   ATLANTIC OCEANOG & METEOROL LAB,MIAMI,FL.\\n   COOPERAT INST MARINE & ATMOSPHER SCI,MIAMI,FL.\\n   CSIRO,DIV OCEANOG,HOBART,TAS,AUSTRALIA.\\nRI Rintoul, Stephen R/A-1471-2012; Thacker, Carlisle C/I-3813-2013;\\n   Tziperman, Eli/A-1219-2008\\nOI Rintoul, Stephen R/0000-0002-7055-9876; Thacker, Carlisle\\n   C/0000-0002-9285-8826; \\nNR 21\\nTC 36\\nZ9 37\\nU1 0\\nU2 0\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693\\nSN 0022-3670\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

The section extends from the surface down to the bottom, and spans the entire mid-ocean circulation regime of the North Atlantic from the subpolar gyre through the subtropical gyre and the equatorial currents. Vertical sections of potential temperature, salinity and potential density from CTD measurements and of oxygen, silica, phosphate and nitrate, based on discrete water-sample measurements are presented and discussed in the context of the large-scale circulation of the North Atlantic Ocean. The close spacing of high-quality stations reveals some features not described previously. The more important findings include: (1) possible recirculation of the lightest Subpolar Mode Water into the tropics; (2) a thermostad at temperatures of 8-9-degrees-C, lying below that of the Equatorial 13-degrees-C Water; (3) the nutrient distribution in the low-salinity water above the Mediterranean Outflow Water that supports the previous conjecture of northern influence of the Antarctic Intermediate Water; (4) a great deal of lateral structure of the Mediterranean Outflow Water, with a number of lobes of high salinity; (5) an abrupt southern boundary of the Labrador Sea Water at the Azores-Biscay Rise and a vertically well-mixed region to its south; (6) a sharp demarcation in the central Iceland Basin between the newest Iceland-Scotland Overflow Water and older bottom water, which has a significant component of southern water; (7) evidence that the Northeast Atlantic Deep Water is a mixture of the Mediterranean Outflow Water and the Northwest Atlantic Bottom Water with very little input from the Iceland-Scotland Overflow Water; (8) an isolated core of the high-salinity, low-silica Upper North Atlantic Deep Water at the equator; (9) a core of the high-oxygen, low-nutrient Lower North Atlantic Deep Water pressed against the southern flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge just south of the equator; (10) a weak minimum of salinity, and well-defined maxima of nutrients associated with the oxygen minimum that separates the Middle and Lower North Atlantic Deep Waters south of the equator; (11) a large body of nearly homogeneous water beneath the Middle North Atlantic Deep Water between 20-degrees-N and the Azores-Biscay Rise; and (12) a deep westward boundary undercurrent on the southern slope of the Rockall Plateau.\\nC1 WOODS HOLE OCEANOG INST,WOODS HOLE,MA 02543.\\nRP TSUCHIYA, M (通讯作者)，UNIV CALIF SAN DIEGO,SCRIPPS INST OCEANOG,LA JOLLA,CA 92093, USA.\\nRI McCartney, Michael S/A-3922-2009\\nOI McCartney, Michael S/0000-0002-3413-7166; Talley,\\n   Lynne/0000-0003-1574-729X\\nNR 67\\nTC 133\\nZ9 133\\nU1 0\\nU2 23\\nPU PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD\\nPI OXFORD\\nPA THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB\\nSN 0198-0149\\nJ9 DEEP-SEA RES\\nPD NOV-DEC\\nPY 1992\\nVL 39\\nIS 11-12A\\nBP 1885\\nEP 1917\\nDI 10.1016/0198-0149(92)90004-D\\nPG 33\\nWC Oceanography\\nWE Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)\\nSC Oceanography\\nGA JY326\\nUT WOS:A1992JY32600004\\nDA 2022-06-16\\nER\\n\\nPT J\\nAU ANDERSON, DM\\n   PRELL, WL\\nAF ANDERSON, DM\\n   PRELL, WL\\nTI THE STRUCTURE OF THE SOUTHWEST MONSOON WINDS OVER THE ARABIAN SEA DURING\\n   THE LATE QUATERNARY - OBSERVATIONS, SIMULATIONS, AND MARINE GEOLOGIC\\n   EVIDENCE\\nSO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS\\nLA English\\nDT Article\\nID INDIAN-OCEAN\\nAB Each summer strong southwest winds produced by the Asian monsoon blow across the NW Arabian Sea, creating a broad region of upwelling characterized by cool sea surface temperatures and enriched phytoplankton biomass. The integrated history of the summer plankton blooms is preserved in the form of distinct plankton fossil assemblages and sediment facies, forming a continuous geologic record of wind-driven upwelling and thus changes in the SW monsoon winds. Sediments have been recovered from two regions in the NW Arabian Sea, one located along the Oman continental margin, and another located approximately 400 km offshore. Over the late Quaternary, these two sites record time series of upwelling that are substantially different. To understand the source of the differences, we examined the relationship between wind stress and upwelling at these sites using historical observations and model-simulated wind fields. In the coastal region, upwelling is directly related to the Ekman transport offshore, and is thus linearly proportional to the alongshore wind stress. Farther offshore, open-ocean upwelling is driven by the positive curl in the wind stress. In historical records, we found little correlation between stronger winds and increased open-ocean upwelling. In the region offshore where the sediment cores were recovered, the year with the strongest winds was accompanied by weaker wind stress curl and diminished upwelling (indicated by warmer sea surface temperatures and decreased phytoplankton pigment content) because the region of maximum wind stress curl moved NW that year. In atmospheric general circulation model experiments using a range of summer insolation forcing, we found large changes in the wind stress curl occur over some areas of the NW Arabian Sea; however the offshore core locations lies outside of the region where changes in the SW monsoon drive large changes in open-ocean upwelling. In contrast to the coastal sites where upwelling is directly related to the wind stress, the offshore sites appear to be located in a region where the wind stress curl does not change much over a large range of summer insolation. There is some evidence from both the interannual and model fields that this location is affected mom by movements in the position of the low-level jet than by changes in the over-all strength of the SW monsoon. Although more data are required to define these patterns, these results indicate that the time series of open-ocean upwelling observed in the geologic record from offshore sites may differ substantially from the coastal time series.\\nC1 UNIV S CAROLINA, DEPT GEOL SCI, COLUMBIA, SC 29208 USA.\\n   BROWN UNIV, DEPT GEOL SCI, PROVIDENCE, RI 02912 USA.\\nRI anderson, david/E-6416-2011\\nNR 20\\nTC 29\\nZ9 29\\nU1 1\\nU2 4\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

The amplification of infragravity-wave energy between 13- and 8-m depth (separated by 1 km in the cross shore) is about 2, indicating that the observed infragravity motions am dominated by free waves, not by group-forced bound waves, which in theory are amplified by an order of magnitude in energy between the two locations. However, bound waves am more important for the relatively few cam with very energetic swell, when the observed amplification between 13- and 8-m depth of infragravity-wave energy was sometimes 3 times greater than expected for free waves. Bispectra are consistent with increased coupling between infragravity waves and groups of swell and sea for high-energy incident waves.\\nC1 UNIV CALIF SAN DIEGO, SCRIPPS INST OCEANOG, LA JOLLA, CA 92093 USA.\\n   QUEST INTEGRATED INC, KENT, WA 98032 USA.\\nRP ELGAR, S (通讯作者)，WASHINGTON STATE UNIV, DEPT ELECT ENGN & COMP SCI, PULLMAN, WA 99164 USA.\\nNR 23\\nTC 83\\nZ9 83\\nU1 0\\nU2 7\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

It appears that a part of the Kuroshio on the cyclonic side overran the shelf break and penetrated northward as a shallow surface current. The remainder of the Kuroshio, presumably affected by the shoaling topography, largely turned and ran along the shelf break to the northeast. Between the two, the flow was weak and disorganized. Conservation of potential vorticity and constancy of the Bernoulli function in an analytical, reduced-gravity model of the incidence of a baroclinic current upon a step shelf lead to an on-shelf flow field that is compatible to the observed hydrographic distributions. In particular, the integrated balance of along-step momentum yields an expression of the angle of intrusion in terms of the incidence angle and of the ratio of step depth to the depth of the upper layer of the ocean. In addition, the transport of the intrusion is shown to be equal to the product of the depth ratio squared and the incident transport. Calculations for the condition of the April survey yield results in agreement with the observation.\\nC1 FLORIDA STATE UNIV, DEPT OCEANOG, TALLAHASSEE, FL 32306 USA.\\n   NATL TAIWAN UNIV, INST OCEANOG, TAIPEI, TAIWAN.\\nOI Wang, Joe/0000-0002-3298-2956\\nNR 9\\nTC 103\\nZ9 118\\nU1 0\\nU2 6\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

In the case of a unidirectional current, a quadratic stress law leads to a stress curl proportional to and opposing the surface current vorticity even with a uniform wind. This causes a spindown effect on the surface vorticity field at a rate proportional to the wind speed. In the steady state, or in slowly varying processes which can be treated as parametrically developing quasi-steady states, the surface-layer potential vorticity modulation causes upwelling and downwelling patterns associated with the surface-current vorticity. These effects are analyzed for an idealized jet current, and for a physical situation characteristic of a Gulf Stream boundary ring along the Florida Keys, where the induced transport patterns may be important for onshore transport of fish and spiny lobster larvae, as well as for onshore transport to the Florida Keys of general flotsam transported past them by the Gulf Stream. The spindown time scale (t*) for a 1.5-layer system is H/(rho\\'c(d)V(a)) for a surface jet on the deformation radius\\' scale (where H is the thickness of the surface layer, V(a) the surface wind speed, rho\\' the air to water density ratio and c(d) the surface drag coefficient) and increases for large horizontal scales in proportion to the current width squared. For a typical wind speed of 5 m/s and a density normalized drag coefficient rho\\'C(d) = 2 x 10(-6) , t* is on the order of 1 month for a 30-m surface layer. In the more general case of a stratified interior water column, the vorticity spindown directly affects only the potential vorticity of the surface layer and generally leads to subsurface velocity and vorticity maxima for mesoscale eddies and jets.\\nC1 UNIV MIAMI, ROSENSTIEL SCH MARINE & ATMOSPHER SCI, DEPT METEOROL & PHYS OCEANOG, MIAMI, FL 33149 USA.\\nNR 11\\nTC 13\\nZ9 13\\nU1 2\\nU2 5\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

In particular, if alpha = dq/d-psi > 0, where q is the absolute vorticity and psi is a streamfunction for the geostrophic flow, then the jet tends to penetrate across to the eastern boundary; conversely if alpha < 0, the jet tums back on itself creating a tight recirculation on the scale of order \\\\alpha\\\\-1/2. This behavior is demonstrated in a quasigeostrophic ocean model in which a jet profile is prescribed as an inflow condition at the western margin of a half-basin, and radiation conditions along the remainder of the western boundary allow the injected fluid to escape. Jet inflows with both vertical and horizontal structure are considered in one and one-half-, two-, and three-layer models.\\n   Finally, the implications of our study for numerical simulations of ocean gyres, which frequently show sensitivity of jet penetration to horizontal and vertical resolution and to choice of boundary conditions, are discussed.

Polarstern across the Nansen Basin, Arctic Ocean. The CCl4/F11 ratio ages are shown to be in good agreement with the apparent tritium/He-3 ages throughout the age range studied (5-30 years) and with F11/F12 ages in the age range for which such comparisons can be made (16-30 years). A simple box model (integrated to 1987) shows that for CCl4/F11 and tritium/He-3 ages less than 12 years, the apparent ages should be close to the mean age of the water sampled. The distribution of the tracer ages is discussed with respect to the circulation of water masses in the Nansen Basin.\\nC1 COLUMBIA UNIV,LAMONT DOHERTY GEOL OBSERV,PALISADES,NY 10964.\\n   COLUMBIA UNIV,DEPT GEOL,PALISADES,NY 10964.\\n   CHALMERS UNIV TECHNOL,DEPT ANALYT & MARINE CHEM,S-41296 GOTHENBURG,SWEDEN.\\n   GOTHENBURG UNIV,S-41296 GOTHENBURG,SWEDEN.\\n   UNIV HEIDELBERG,INST UMWELTPHYS,W-6900 HEIDELBERG,GERMANY.\\nRP WALLACE, DWR (通讯作者)，BROOKHAVEN NATL LAB,DEPT APPL SCI,DIV OCEANOG & ATMOSPHER SCI,UPTON,NY 11973, USA.\\nRI Schlosser, Peter/C-6416-2012\\nOI Schlosser, Peter/0000-0002-6514-4203\\nNR 39\\nTC 39\\nZ9 40\\nU1 0\\nU2 8\\nPU PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD\\nPI OXFORD\\nPA THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB\\nSN 0198-0149\\nJ9 DEEP-SEA RES\\nPD SEP\\nPY 1992\\nVL 39\\nIS 2A\\nSU S\\nBP S435\\nEP S458\\nDI 10.1016/S0198-0149(06)80015-4\\nPG 24\\nWC Oceanography\\nWE Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)\\nSC Oceanography\\nGA JU309\\nUT WOS:A1992JU30900003\\nDA 2022-06-16\\nER\\n\\nPT J\\nAU BAUER, E\\n   HASSELMANN, S\\n   HASSELMANN, K\\n   GRABER, HC\\nAF BAUER, E\\n   HASSELMANN, S\\n   HASSELMANN, K\\n   GRABER, HC\\nTI VALIDATION AND ASSIMILATION OF SEASAT ALTIMETER WAVE HEIGHTS USING THE\\n   WAM WAVE MODEL\\nSO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS\\nLA English\\nDT Article\\nID NONLINEAR ENERGY-TRANSFER; WIND AMBIGUITY REMOVAL; OCEAN WAVE; SATELLITE\\n   SCATTEROMETER; DIRECT MINIMIZATION; SURFACE WIND; SPECTRUM; SPEED; SASS;\\n   PARAMETERIZATIONS\\nAB The mutual consistency of the Seasat global data sets of scatterometer winds and altimeter wave heights is investigated for the complete Seasat period using the third-generation wave model WAM. The wave model was driven by surface (1000 hPa) wind and surface stress fields constructed by the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres (GLA) by assimilation of the scatterometer winds in an atmospheric model. For the 10-day period September 7-17 the intercomparison was extended to two further scatterometer wind fields: a 1000-hPa assimilated wind field from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and a subjectively analyzed 19.5-m-height surface wind field from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, On the global average, the modeled and observed wave heights agree reasonably well. Regional differences, however, can be large and sometimes exceed 40%. The errors are attributed mainly to deficiencies in the forcing wind fields. Low wind speeds are found to be overestimated and high wind speeds underestimated by the Seasat scatterometer algorithm. The friction velocities of the GLA model are found to be significantly underestimated in the high-wind belt of the southern hemisphere. The analysis demonstrates the diagnostic advantages of applying a wave model for the quality assessment of satellite wind and wave data. A preliminary wave data assimilation scheme is presented in which the wave field is updated without changing the forcing wind field. A considerable improvement of the computed wave field is achieved, particularly in regions in which the wave energy is dominated by swell. However, a more general assimilation scheme including modifications of the wind field is needed to upgrade wind sea forecasts.\\nC1 MAX PLANCK INST METEOROL, HAMBURG, GERMANY.\\n   WOODS HOLE OCEANOG INST, WOODS HOLE, MA 02543 USA.\\nNR 41\\nTC 42\\nZ9 51\\nU1 0\\nU2 1\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

Marine Chemistry, 11, 159-167) nitrite method that permits measurements down to subnanomolar concentrations and present data from Atlantic and Caribbean deepwater profiles for comparison with a published Pacific section.\\n   This important intermediate in the nitrogen cycle was detected in all samples. Concentrations were consistently lowest (0.1-0.4 nM) in oligotrophic surface waters. Below 1 km. Caribbean and Southwest Sargasso sea nitrite concentrations were 0.4-1 nM, decreasing with increasing depth; reported Pacific [NO2-] averages are several times higher. Profiles in the upper kilometer beneath the classical primary nitrite maximum (PNM) were qualitatively similar, exhibiting a smooth supra-exponential drop with depth to values of approximately 1-4 nM at 1 km.\\n   The nitrite inventory in this \"tail\" of the PNM above 1 km with 1 nM less-than-or-equal-to [NO2-] less-than-or-equal-to 50 nM roughly equals that in the classical PNM. Significant differences among profiles in the 0.1-1 km region are observed, consistent with nitrite pool turnover times of 3-7 days estimated from Redfield stoichiometry and tritium-helium ages. Thus seasonal and/or regional variations in factors altering the nitrite production-consumption balance, rather than transport, seem to be responsible for nitrite variability.\\n   Nitrite profiles with anomalous midwater or near-bottom fine structure, including multi-point maxima and minima, were found along the Venezuelan continental margin and at approximately 13-degrees-N. These features are tentatively ascribed to boundary effects, as hydrographic and circumstantial evidence suggests that these waters interacted previously with the bottom.\\nRP ZAFIRIOU, OC (通讯作者)，WOODS HOLE OCEANOG INST,DEPT CHEM,WOODS HOLE,MA 02543, USA.\\nRI Hanley, Quentin/B-6730-2011; Hanley, Quentin/N-2253-2019\\nOI Hanley, Quentin/0000-0002-8189-9550\\nNR 30\\nTC 27\\nZ9 30\\nU1 1\\nU2 5\\nPU PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD\\nPI OXFORD\\nPA THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB\\nSN 0198-0149\\nJ9 DEEP-SEA RES\\nPD JUL-AUG\\nPY 1992\\nVL 39\\nIS 7-8A\\nBP 1329\\nEP 1347\\nDI 10.1016/0198-0149(92)90072-2\\nPG 19\\nWC Oceanography\\nWE Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)\\nSC Oceanography\\nGA JH540\\nUT WOS:A1992JH54000017\\nDA 2022-06-16\\nER\\n\\nPT J\\nAU LUKAS, R\\n   WEBSTER, PJ\\nAF LUKAS, R\\n   WEBSTER, PJ\\nTI TOGA-COARE - TROPICAL OCEAN GLOBAL ATMOSPHERE PROGRAM AND COUPLED\\n   OCEAN-ATMOSPHERE RESPONSE EXPERIMENT\\nSO OCEANUS\\nLA English\\nDT Article\\nC1 UNIV COLORADO,PROGRAM ATMOSPHER & OCEAN SCI,BOULDER,CO 80309.\\nRP LUKAS, R (通讯作者)，UNIV HAWAII,DEPT OCEANOG,HONOLULU,HI 96822, USA.\\nRI Lukas, Roger B/B-3715-2009\\nNR 0\\nTC 7\\nZ9 10\\nU1 0\\nU2 4\\nPU WOODS HOLE OCEANOGRAPHIC INST\\nPI WOODS HOLE\\nPA OCEANUS MAGAZINE, WOODS HOLE, MA 02543\\nSN 0029-8182\\nJ9 OCEANUS\\nJI Oceanus\\nPD SUM\\nPY 1992\\nVL 35\\nIS 2\\nBP 62\\nEP 65\\nPG 4\\nWC Oceanography\\nWE Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)\\nSC Oceanography\\nGA JF759\\nUT WOS:A1992JF75900011\\nDA 2022-06-16\\nER\\n\\nPT J\\nAU SPRINGERYOUNG, M\\n   PIOTROWICZ, SR\\n   HARVEY, GR\\nAF SPRINGERYOUNG, M\\n   PIOTROWICZ, SR\\n   HARVEY, GR\\nTI IMPACT OF AN EPISODIC EVENT ON COPPER AND ZINC CONCENTRATIONS AND\\n   SPECIATION IN SURFACE WATERS OF THE GULF OF MEXICO\\nSO DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART A-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS\\nLA English\\nDT Article\\nID ANODIC-STRIPPING VOLTAMMETRY; CENTRAL NORTH PACIFIC; SEA-WATER;\\n   TRACE-METALS; COMPLEXING CAPACITY; DISSOLVED COPPER; ATLANTIC-OCEAN;\\n   CADMIUM; LEAD; COMPLEXATION\\nAB Electrochemical and chelation/extraction trace metal techniques are used to develop an understanding of changes in copper and zinc concentrations and speciation associated with a hydrographic and atmospheric event which occurred during an 8-day station in the Gulf of Mexico.

Surface motion measurements using geophones and accelerometers on multiyear pack ice are used to establish the energy level of these motions and to differentiate between the different modes of propagation. Gravity waves are dominant below about 0.05 Hz, with their direction and dispersion relation being confirmed with vector measurements of acceleration from two stations. Motions driven by surface pressure fluctuations in the local wind appear at somewhat higher frequencies up to about 0.3 Hz and are particularly evident on thinner first-year ice during periods of high wind. The band from 0.1 to 10 Hz comprises mainly flexural waves, as determined by their dispersion relation, and these are prominent during local ridge building events. At frequencies above 10 Hz, there is a combination of acoustic and flexural modes of propagation, with one or the other being dominant during specific environmental events. The probability density function of power in octave wide bands is approximately lognormal as a result of the high level of intermittence of local events. The variance in power level is significantly smaller for waterborne noise from more distant sources. Specific examples are used to illustrate the nature of the events.\\nC1 ARETE ASSOCIATES, ARLINGTON, VA 22215 USA.\\nNR 25\\nTC 7\\nZ9 7\\nU1 0\\nU2 5\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

Oceanic mixing is described according to the level 2.5 turbulence closure scheme in which convection occurs in a continuous way, i.e., convective adjustment is not invoked. The model is forced by strong winds and surface cooling. Strong upwelling at the multiyear ice edge and consequent entrainment of warm Atlantic waters into the mixed layer is produced by winds parallel to the ice edge. Concomitant cooling drives deep convection and produces chimneylike structures. Inclusion of a barotropic mean flow over topography to the model provides important preconditioning and selects the location of deep convection. The most efficient preconditioning occurs at locations where the flow ascends a slope. In a stratified environment similar to the Greenland Sea with a 12 m s-1 wind the model simulations show that localized deep convection takes place after about 10 days to depths of 1000 m.\\nC1 PRINCETON UNIV, ATMOSPHER & OCEAN SCI PROGRAM, PRINCETON, NJ 08544 USA.\\nRI Kantha, Lakshmi/G-2942-2013; Hakkinen, Sirpa/E-1461-2012\\nNR 35\\nTC 19\\nZ9 19\\nU1 0\\nU2 2\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

These larvae could be from a previously unknown population north of Cape Hatteras or they could have been transported north from southern populations.  In order to examine these two hypotheses both biological and physical oceanographic data were considered, including size-specific larval distribution, larval age, vertical distribution of larvae, satellite imagery of sea surface temperature, and temperature and salinity measurements.  Larvae captured during our 1988 ichthyoplankton cruises ranged from 3.11 mm to 13.13 mm in length with small larvae (less-than-or-equal-to 5 mm) found in association with the shelf break and larger larvae (> 5 mm) found distributed across the outer shelf and shelf break.  Based on aging of daily otolith increments larval age was found to range from 7 to 36 days and backcalculated brithdates, derived from estimated age and date of capture, were found to be from mid-June to early August.  Larvae occurred predominantly near the surface (less-than-or-equal-to 10 m) at night and deeper (> 10 m) during the day.  Concurrent hydrographic data revealed that small larvae were found in shelf water (< 35 psu) but with underlying slope water (> 35 psu) at depths of 15-30 m suggesting that small larvae were in shelf water at night but either at the boundary with or within slope water during the day.  Satellite imagery from 1988 revealed a warm-core ring offshore of our 1988 sampling area.  An analysis of historical warm-core ring data from Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization data reports in conjunction with captures of X. novacula during the years 1984-1987 demonstrated that the presence of warm-core rings offshore was associated with the occurrence of X. novacula on the MAB shelf, north of Chesapeake Bay.  The feasibility of northward transport associated with the Gulf Stream and cross-slope transport associated with a warm-core ring was examined with a simple model which demonstrated that the required transport velocities were within the range of velocities presented in the literature.  It is suggested that larvae are rapidly transported from south of Cape Hatteras to the MAB shelf break by advection associated with the Gulf Stream and a concomitant cross-slope flow related with the western edge of warm-core rings.\\nRP HARE, JA (通讯作者)，SUNY STONY BROOK,MARINE SCI RES CTR,STONY BROOK,NY 11794, USA.\\nNR 84\\nTC 54\\nZ9 55\\nU1 0\\nU2 5\\nPU KLINE GEOLOGY LABORATORY\\nPI NEW HAVEN\\nPA YALE UNIV, NEW HAVEN, CT 06520\\nSN 0022-2402\\nJ9 J MAR RES\\nJI J.

Model results are compared with lysocline data from 13 regions in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. The model lysocline shape is sensitive to the calcite dissolution rate constant, the calcite, organic carbon, and refractory material rates, and the rates of oxic versus anoxic organic carbon degradation in the sediment. The model is able to reproduce the observed lysocline, Within the constraints of the sediment trap and calcite accumulation data, using a calcite dissolution rate constant of 30-100%d-1, a molar ratio of organic carbon to calcite rain rates of 0.5-1.0, and an initial CaCO3 fraction of 90% (excluding organic carbon). This rate constant is consistent with microelectrode results presented by Archer et al. [1989]. The model predicts that 30-50% of the calcite rain to the sea floor at the saturation horizon dissolves in response to organic carbon respiration, consistent with previous modeling studies. The range in the best fit value of the organic-inorganic carbon rain rates arises from model sensitivity to uncertainty in the rate of anoxic carbon degradation in the sediment and in the rain rate of refractory material, rather than from scatter in the data. Lysocline data from the western equatorial Atlantic are anomalous to the rest of the data; this anomaly may be explained by high rates of refractory material sedimentation from the Amazon River.\\nC1 COLUMBIA UNIV, LAMONT DOHERTY GEOL OBSERV, PALISADES, NY 10964 USA.\\nRI Archer, David/K-7371-2012\\nOI Archer, David/0000-0002-4523-7912\\nNR 48\\nTC 131\\nZ9 131\\nU1 2\\nU2 34\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

Undersea Biomed Res 1991; 18(5-6):433-443.-Daily diving patterns and thoracic skin and sea-water temperatures were recorded during the entire work shift of Korean female unassisted (cachido) and Japanese male unassisted and partly assisted (funado) divers using Underwater Physiological Data Loggers developed in Buffalo and Japan. All 3 groups of divers were studied during the summer of 1989 and 1990. Additional studies were conducted during the winter of 1991 on Korean female divers who, unlike Japanese divers, dive all year round. The water temperature of the diving grounds in summer was 24-degrees-C in both Korea and Japan, and 10-degrees-C during winter in Korea. Both Korean female and Japanese male cachido divers made 113-138 dives a day and stayed in the water a total of 170-200 min . day-1, of which only 52-63 min were spent diving submerged, and the remaining time at the water surface. These diving patterns were not different between female and male cachido divers. Compared with Japanese male divers, Korean female divers dived to a shallower depth (3.7 vs. 6.9 m) with shorter dive time (29 vs. 37 s) and shorter bottom time (14 vs. 18 s). Velocities of descent (0.72 vs. 0.47 m . s-1) and ascent (0.77 vs. 0.56 m . s-1) were also slower in female divers than in male divers. The diving pattern of Korean female divers was similar in both summer and winter. Although all cachido divers wore wet suits and thus were protected from severe cold stress, thoracic skin temperature decreased during a work shift by 7-degrees-C in winter (vs. 1-degrees-C in summer) in Korean divers. Compared with Japanese male cachido divers, Japanese male funado divers stayed in the diving ground (including time in the boat) longer (201 vs. 305 min , day-1) but performed only 23 dives per day. The average diving depth (9.7 m), duration (69 s), and bottom time for each dive (45 s), however, were significantly greater in funados. The velocity of vertical descent (1.0 m . s-1) was also significantly greater in funados because they descend with a weight (8-12 kg).

This subdivision, or population genetic structure, may be generated by the interplay of biological processes (reproduction, dispersal, differential mortality) and physical forces governing planktonic distributions. Significant population genetic structure in the planktonic copepod Metridia pacifica occurred during a period of upwelling in the coastal transition zone off the west coast of the United States during April and May 1987. During this period a coastal eddy of saline, recently upwelled water was bordered by a southward flowing current stream; offshore waters were nutrient poor and slower flowing. Metridia pacifica was the most abundant copepod in zooplankton samples collected in this domain; the species was sufficiently abundant in 16 samples to allow genetic analysis. Individual copepods were assayed for allozymic variability by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The samples were genetically heterogeneous (by a contingency chi-square analysis of allozymic frequencies). The genetic differentiation of the samples was characteristic of geographically separated conspecific populations. Cladistic (tree building) analyses were used to visualize the genetic relatedness of the 16 samples, based on the similarity of allozymic frequencies. This analysis resulted in two heterogeneous groups (of five and six samples each) and five anomalous samples that neither constituted a third group nor belonged to the two groups. Overlay of these groupings on the dynamic height topographies showed a concordance between the population genetic and oceanographic structures. Five of the six offshore samples belonged to one group; the five samples of the other group were found either in the eddy (two of three central eddy samples) or in the current jet. The remaining five samples were scattered in nearshore regions or in the frontal region between the eddy and offshore. The division of the samples into eddy and offshore groups may result from redistribution by currents of planktonic populations of different geographic origin and distinct genetic character. Thus the eddy may have entrained copepod populations originating from different source regions than the populations in offshore waters. Further genetic analysis on appropriate time and space scales will be required to determine the mechanisms generating structure in oceanic zooplankton.\\nC1 JOHNS HOPKINS UNIV, CHESAPEAKE BAY INST, SHADY SIDE, MD USA.\\n   OFF NAVAL RES, OCEAN BIOL PROGRAM, ARLINGTON, VA 22217 USA.\\nOI Bucklin, Ann/0000-0003-3750-9348\\nNR 34\\nTC 31\\nZ9 33\\nU1 0\\nU2 5\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

The experiment consisted of two hydrographic surveys and a three-dimensional instrumented array that included 51 current/temperature sensors distributed on 18 moorings. Moorings were maintained across the mouth of the Strait of Juan de Fuca (to monitor the fluctuating buoyant source/sink) and along three cross-shelf transects roughly 40, 90, and 130 km north of the mouth of the strait. To detect possible incoming propagating coastal-trapped waves (CTWs), moorings were also located approximately 10 and approximately 30 km south of the mouth of the strait. The main thrust of the experiment was to attempt to identify signals specifically associated with buoyant outflow from the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Four such signals were identified. (1) A seasonally varying mean poleward flow over the mid and inner shelf. (2) Velocity and temperature fluctuations associated with buoyant plumes over the shelf. The plumes, which occur at roughly monthly and bimonthly intervals, are driven by anomalously strong freshwater pulses from the strait, and the associated fluctuations in the along-isobath component of velocity accounted for about 20% (10%) of the variance during summer (fall) in the region within about 50 km of the mouth of the strait. (3) Positive temperature anomalies (approximately 3-degrees-C) related to the cessation of strait outflow. These anomalies, which are strongest at and south of the mouth of the strait, occur during periods of regional southwesterly winds and have a south-to-north lag consistent with poleward advection of the pre-existing (usually cold) plume water at about 30 km d-1. (4) Phase modification of the wind-driven CTW and local wind-driven velocity signals across the mouth of the strait: a south to north phase difference of about 90-degrees is observed across the mouth of the strait at low (< 0.12 cpd) frequencies during both summer and fall. Statistical analysis as well as application of a first-mode wind-driven CTW model demonstrated that the dominant variance over the Vancouver Island shelf is related primarily to the first-mode wind-driven CTW (summer, approximately 55%) or local wind forcing (fall, approximately 80%). This being the case, and also because of the rugged shelf topography in the area, the analysis proved insufficient to identify definitively more subtle results of plume and strait processes such as the local generation of CTWs.\\nC1 INST OCEAN SCI, SIDNEY V8L 4B2, BC, CANADA.\\n   UNIV BRITISH COLUMBIA, DEPT OCEANOG, VANCOUVER V6T 1W5, BC, CANADA.\\nRP HICKEY, BM (通讯作者)，UNIV WASHINGTON, SCH OCEANOG, WB-10, SEATTLE, WA 98195 USA.\\nNR 61\\nTC 71\\nZ9 73\\nU1 1\\nU2 6\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

The model is forced by a prescribed interannually variable atmosphere. Simulations are conducted for a 120-month period and validated with observed ice concentration data. The model produces very reasonable simulations of the ice edge position, particularly in the Barents and Greenland seas. The use of interannual ocean forcing produces major improvements to the simulation of the ice concentration for both the annual cycle and interannual variations, as compared with simulations in which the ocean forcing is a prescribed mean annual cycle. Vertical ocean heat flux appears to be the dominant mechanism controlling localized ice area anomalies and the overall ice concentration. Consistent errors in simulated ice concentration and thickness remain, including a slightly exaggerated melt-freeze cycle and insufficient ice thickness. The lack of a nonprognostic mixed layer and the coarse vertical resolution are apparently inadequate to represent the vertical mixing, stratification, and diffusion processes properly.\\nC1 USN, POSTRAD SCH, DEPT OCEANOG, MONTEREY, CA 93943 USA.\\nNR 18\\nTC 21\\nZ9 21\\nU1 0\\nU2 1\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

Chlorophyll a concentrations in open water during this period were extremely low, with surface values averaging 0.022-mu-g L-1. Vertical mixed layers were deep, ranging from 40 to 200 m, and surface incident irradiance was low (average of 44-mu-mol photons m-2 s-1 at local noon). The biomass of the microplankton was dominated by three groups: autotrophic flagellates (less than 10-mu-m), heterotrophic flagellates (less than 10-mu-m), and heterotrophic dinoflagellates (from 10 to 35-mu-m). Detrital carbon contributed the largest fraction (on average 95%) to the particulate carbon pool. Photosynthesis-irradiance responses indicated that the resident phytoplankton populations were adapted to low irradiance levels, as would be expected after the long periods of darkness encountered during the Arctic winter. Estimates of primary productivity during the March-April period indicate that very little net carbon fixation was occurring (averaging 1.84 mg C m-2 d-1 with a maximum of 3.3 mg C m-2 d-1). Some small increases in surface chlorophyll concentrations (relative to those at the base of the mixed layer) were noted at a few stations, and hence the onset of spring growth may have just begun. However, in view of the biomass and productivity observed during this period, the accumulation of substantial phytoplankton standing stocks, which are often observed at the ice edge, cannot occur until much later in the growing season at this northerly location.\\nC1 UNIV TENNESSEE, GRAD PROGRAM ECOL, KNOXVILLE, TN 37996 USA.\\n   UNIV WASHINGTON, DEPT OCEANOG, WB-10, SEATTLE, WA 98195 USA.\\nRP SMITH, WO (通讯作者)，UNIV TENNESSEE, DEPT BOT, KNOXVILLE, TN 37996 USA.\\nNR 33\\nTC 15\\nZ9 15\\nU1 0\\nU2 3\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

The analysis focuses primarily on daily to monthly time scale variations during the 1986-1987 El Nino/Southern Oscillation event. The period is one of high mean sea surface temperature (greater-than-or-similar-to 29-degrees-C) and frequent outbreaks of westerly winds. We infer that evaporative cooling related to wind speed variations accounts for a significant fraction of the observed sea surface temperature (SST) and upper ocean heat content variability. This evaporative heat flux converges nonlinearly in the surface layer, giving rise to larger temperature variations in the upper 10 m than below. Other processes examined (wind-force vertical advection and entrainment, lateral advection) were negligible or of secondary importance relative to evaporative cooling. A large fraction of the SST and surface layer heat content variance could not be directly related to wind fluctuations; this unexplained variance is probably related to shortwave radiative fluxes at the air-sea interface.\\nRP MCPHADEN, MJ (通讯作者)，NOAA, PACIFIC MARINE ENVIRONM LAB, 7600 SAND POINT WAY, SEATTLE, WA 98115 USA.\\nRI McPhaden, Michael J/D-9799-2016\\nOI McPhaden, Michael J/0000-0002-8423-5805\\nNR 27\\nTC 73\\nZ9 77\\nU1 1\\nU2 4\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

We show these pressure fluctuations are caused by freely propagating ocean surface waves. The waves are generated in the near shore region along the entire coastline of an ocean basin through nonlinear transfer of energy from short-period waves. This view contrasts with some earlier work, which described these long-period pressure fluctuations as trapped waves tied to groups of short waves. We have constructed a model based on the average energy in the short (wind driven and swell) wave band along the North Atlantic coast to predict the energy in the long wave band at a site in the Atlantic. Maximum likelihood wave number-frequency spectra calculated on data from an 11 element array in the North Pacific confirm that the long wave energy is confined to wave numbers corresponding to the surface gravity wave dispersion relation. We have used the wave number spectra to isolate particular regions of the Pacific Ocean which are sources of long wave energy. Energetic short-period waves are incident on the coastline in these regions. Long waves are detected at the array which originate in the Gulf of Alaska, the northwestern Pacific, and at the southern tip of South America.\\nRP WEBB, SC (通讯作者)，UNIV CALIF SAN DIEGO, SCRIPPS INST OCEANOG, LA JOLLA, CA 92093 USA.\\nRI Crawford, Wayne C/A-5658-2011\\nOI Crawford, Wayne C/0000-0002-3260-1826; Webb, Spahr/0000-0002-7277-174X\\nNR 42\\nTC 117\\nZ9 119\\nU1 0\\nU2 23\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

The analyses apply over scales from centimeters to meters (e.g. from copepods to fish larvae), and we assume food-limited conditions, since, otherwise, patchiness would not affect growth.  A model of individual growth response to fluctuating food is developed which shows that growth is approximately exponential and is linearly related to food concentration.  A random walk model reveals that the swimming process can be approximated as a simple diffusion term which, when included in the exponential growth model, leads to accumulation of consumers in high growth ( = prey) areas.  This diffusive migration of consumers up the prey gradient is rapid; for example, half- maximum growth is reached in < 2 hours for fish larvae swimming in a 10 m patch of copepod nauplii.  Enhancement of the net growth by this process is substantial; larval fish growth rates increase by 25% when 10 m prey patches appear at 5 hour intervals and by > 100% for steady patches.  Physical turbulence, at intermediate levels, causes patch dissipation and reduced growth, whereas, at higher levels, it causes growth to be restored to original, low-turbulence, values due to increased encounter velocities.  Variations in population growth rate due to turbulence and micropatchiness, even when small (< 10%), can cause large fluctuations in recruitment by affecting duration of pre-recruit life.\\nC1 MIT,DEPT EARTH ATMOSPHER & PLANETARY SCI,CAMBRIDGE,MA 02139.\\nRP DAVIS, CS (通讯作者)，WOODWARD CLYDE CONSULTANTS,DEPT BIOL,SAN FRANCISCO,CA 94111, USA.\\nNR 53\\nTC 147\\nZ9 147\\nU1 0\\nU2 13\\nPU KLINE GEOLOGY LABORATORY\\nPI NEW HAVEN\\nPA YALE UNIV, NEW HAVEN, CT 06520\\nSN 0022-2402\\nJ9 J MAR RES\\nJI J.

About two-thirds of the way from the Brazil Current in the west to the Benguela Current in the east, we encountered a large-diameter eddy (300-400 km).  Its dynamic signature (bowl-shaped isopyenals) penetrated to over 4000 m, with the eddy anticyclonic transport relative to 4000 db over 30 x 10(6) m3 s 1.  Various origins for this eddy are conceivable.  We feel that the most likely one is the Agulhas Retroflection region:  that the eddy was formed by a pinching off of this current elbow, and a subsequent northwest movement of more than 2500 km over a period spanning two winters.  There was a superposed double thermostad in the core of the eddy interpreted to the product of two successive winters\\' convective overturning.  Main thermocline waters from the Agulhas Current, recognizable by the distribution of oxygen, were trapped in the eddy core and carried with it.  This trapping could extend as deep as the Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW).  The propagating eddy distored the local property distributions.  A ring of low-oxygen water from lower latitudes surrounded the core of the eddy at the thermocline levels.  AAIW of higher salinity and lower oxygen, and Deep Water of higher salinity and lower nutrients were observed at the eddy stations.  These characteristics are also found to the north of the eddy.  The kinematics of a drifting anticyclonic eddy provides a framework for understanding the trapping, the low-oxygen ring, and the pulling underneath of the AAIW and Deep Water.\\nRP MCCARTNEY, MS (通讯作者)，WOODS HOLE OCEANOG INST,WOODS HOLE,MA 02543, USA.\\nRI McCartney, Michael S/A-3922-2009\\nOI McCartney, Michael S/0000-0002-3413-7166\\nNR 31\\nTC 37\\nZ9 37\\nU1 0\\nU2 4\\nPU PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD\\nPI OXFORD\\nPA THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB\\nSN 0198-0149\\nJ9 DEEP-SEA RES\\nPY 1991\\nVL 38\\nSU 1\\nBP S411\\nEP S443\\nDI 10.1016/S0198-0149(12)80019-7\\nPG 33\\nWC Oceanography\\nWE Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)\\nSC Oceanography\\nGA GD479\\nUT WOS:A1991GD47900019\\nDA 2022-06-16\\nER\\n\\nPT J\\nAU REEBURGH, WS\\n   WARD, BB\\n   WHALEN, SC\\n   SANDBECK, KA\\n   KILPATRICK, KA\\n   KERKHOF, LJ\\nAF REEBURGH, WS\\n   WARD, BB\\n   WHALEN, SC\\n   SANDBECK, KA\\n   KILPATRICK, KA\\n   KERKHOF, LJ\\nTI BLACK-SEA METHANE GEOCHEMISTRY\\nSO DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART A-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS\\nLA English\\nDT Article\\nID CARIACO TRENCH; OXIDATION; SEDIMENTS; WATERS; RATES; INHIBITION;\\n   HYDROGEN; LAYER; OCEAN; BAY\\nAB Methane concentrations and oxidation rates were measured in the water column and sediments of the Black Sea at a central station during leg 5 of the 1988 U.S.-Turkey Black Sea Expedition.  Methane concentrations were 10 nM in the upper 100 m, increased to 11-mu-M at 550 m, and were uniform to the bottom.  Water column methane oxidation rates were measured using two independent radiotracer techniques:  tracer level additions of H-3-CH4 and non-tracer level additions of C-14-CH4.  The methods agree within a factor of two.  Methane oxidation rates were low in the surface 100 m and increased to relatively uniform values of 0.6-mu-M y-1 below 500 m.  Sediment methane concentration and oxidation rate distributions showed that shelf and slope sediments were methane sources, while deep basin sediments were methane sinks.\\n   These measurements were used to construct a methane budget for Black Sea waters.  Microbially mediated anaerobic methane oxidation is the dominant water column methane sink, followed by evasion to the atmosphere, abyssal plain sediment consumption and outflow at the Bosporus.  The source of methane appears to be anoxic, high deposition rate shelf and slope sediments.  The water column oxidation rate measurements suggest a short (5-20 year) residence time for methane in the Black Sea, indicating a higher geochemical activity than previously believed.  The quantity of carbon participating in the Black Sea methane cycle is equivalent to about 0.5% of the primary production.\\nC1 UNIV CALIF SAN DIEGO,SCRIPPS INST OCEANOG,LA JOLLA,CA 92093.\\nRP REEBURGH, WS (通讯作者)，UNIV ALASKA,INST MARINE SCI,FAIRBANKS,AK 99775, USA.\\nNR 64\\nTC 187\\nZ9 194\\nU1 2\\nU2 31\\nPU PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD\\nPI OXFORD\\nPA THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB\\nSN 0198-0149\\nJ9 DEEP-SEA RES\\nPY 1991\\nVL 38\\nSU 2\\nBP S1189\\nEP S1210\\nPG 22\\nWC Oceanography\\nWE Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)\\nSC Oceanography\\nGA HB279\\nUT WOS:A1991HB27900029\\nDA 2022-06-16\\nER\\n\\nPT J\\nAU TAFT, BA\\n   HAYES, SP\\n   FRIEDERICH, GE\\n   CODISPOTI, A\\nAF TAFT, BA\\n   HAYES, SP\\n   FRIEDERICH, GE\\n   CODISPOTI, A\\nTI FLOW OF ABYSSAL WATER INTO THE SAMOA PASSAGE\\nSO DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART A-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS\\nLA English\\nDT Article\\nID SOUTH-PACIFIC\\nAB On the TEW Expedition a hydrographic section was made in June 1987 across the Samoa Passage; in addition, south of the Passage, a section was made through the Penrhyn and Samoa Basins and the Tonga Trench. In this paper the flow of the deep water with North Atlantic Deep Water and Antarctic characteristics below 3500 m is discussed. Temperature-salinity-oxygen relationships show a similarity of properties between the Tonga Trench and western boundary of the Samoa Basin. The salinity and silicate date show distinct signatures of North Atlantic Deep Water and Antarctic Bottom Water flowing into the Samoa Passage. Salinity and silicate data in the Samoa Basin and Passage are similar to those measured on the STYX Expedition (1968). Oxygen data show that the water along the Samoa Basin\\'s western boundary is oxygen-rich relative to water in the eastern Basin, but with no oxygen maximum in deep water, as was observed on STYX. Geostrophic flow, based on a reference surface determined from T-S, O2 curves, shows strong northward components (> 10 cm s-1) in the Samoa Passage. On the west side of the Passage the flow was southward (< 1 cm s-1) below 4600 m. This flow reversal was associated with a reversal of the sign of the horizontal potential temperature gradient and also with lower values of oxygen, salinity and silicate next to the boundary. The northward transport of Lower Circumpolar Water between the Manihiki Plateau and the Tonga Trench was 12.3 +/- 3.6 x 10(6) m3 s-1; the flow into the Samoa Passage was 6.0 +/- 1.1 x 10(6) m3 s-1. Assuming that only flow above 4800 m can exit the northern Samoa Basin because of topographic restrictions, the total northward transport into the north Tokelau Basin was 9.6 +/- 1.8 x 10(6) m3 s-1.\\nC1 WOCE INT PROJECT OFF, IOS DEACON LAB, WORMLEY GU8 5UB, SURREY, ENGLAND.\\n   MONTEREY BAY AQUARIUM RES INST, PACIFIC GROVE, CA 93950 USA.\\nRP TAFT, BA (通讯作者)，NOAA, PACIFIC MARINE ENVIRONM LAB, 7600 SAND POINT WAY NE, SEATTLE, WA 98115 USA.\\nNR 17\\nTC 31\\nZ9 33\\nU1 0\\nU2 5\\nPU PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD\\nPI OXFORD\\nPA THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND\\nSN 0198-0149\\nJ9 DEEP-SEA RES\\nPY 1991\\nVL 38\\nSU 1\\nBP S103\\nEP S128\\nDI 10.1016/S0198-0149(12)80007-0\\nPG 26\\nWC Oceanography\\nWE Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)\\nSC Oceanography\\nGA GD479\\nUT WOS:A1991GD47900007\\nDA 2022-06-16\\nER\\n\\nPT J\\nAU SERREZE, MC\\n   MASLANIK, JA\\n   PRELLER, RH\\n   BARRY, RG\\nAF SERREZE, MC\\n   MASLANIK, JA\\n   PRELLER, RH\\n   BARRY, RG\\nTI SEA ICE CONCENTRATIONS IN THE CANADA BASIN DURING 1988 - COMPARISONS\\n   WITH OTHER YEARS AND EVIDENCE OF MULTIPLE FORCING MECHANISMS\\nSO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS\\nLA English\\nDT Article\\nID ARCTIC BASIN; SATELLITE; SUMMER; MODEL; ZONE; CLOUDINESS; EXCHANGE;\\n   IMAGERY; MOTION\\nAB During summer 1988, a large area of reduced ice concentration developed within the Arctic pack ice of the Canada Basin. Data from the special sensor microwave imager (SSM/I) and visible-band imagery show that by early September, this feature extended north of 80-degrees-N, with SSM/I-derived ice concentrations of 40-80% covering an area approximately 1.0 x 10(6) km2. Drifting buoys, surface pressure fields, output from the Polar Ice Prediction System (PIPS) sea ice model and other meteorological data are used to examine processes responsible for development of the reduced ice concentrations. While the model indicates that ice divergence in summer offers a partial explanation, (1) anomalously warm atmospheric conditions, (2) generally clear skies in June and July, (3) extensive fracturing of the pack ice in spring and, perhaps, (4) anomalous advection of oceanic heat may all have played contributing roles. However, the second and third of these effects may occur in most years. Coupled with additional observations suggestive of recurring bathymetrically induced effects on lateral transport of ocean heat, we conclude that although the extent and magnitude of the concentration reductions during 1988 are unusual, these recurring factors tend to predispose the pack ice in the Canada Basin to decay.\\nC1 UNIV COLORADO, NOAA, COOPERAT INST RES ENVIRONM SCI, BOULDER, CO 80309 USA.\\n   USN, OCEAN & ATMOSPHER RES LAB, STENNIS SPACE CTR, MS 39529 USA.\\nNR 51\\nTC 7\\nZ9 7\\nU1 0\\nU2 4\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

To accomplish this, we compute empirical orthogonal function (EOF) maps based on the ocean-model part of the DAC, then fit the GRACE and Jason data to those maps. The resulting DAC and GRACE EOF time-series are compared to the altimetry EOF time-series, to determine which best represents the state of the ocean. We find that, for the first six modes in the North Pacific, 19 modes in the Southern Ocean, and three modes in the combined Indian/Atlantic/Equatorial-Pacific region, GRACE is able to explain more of the 10-20-day altimetry signal than the original de-aliasing model can. We recombine these first GRACE modes with the remaining ocean-only DAC data to produce an improved 10-20-day model during times when GRACE data exists. We smoothly blend that series with the original model during times when there is no GRACE data, also restoring the faster frequencies from the original. The result is a blended model which explains 10%-30% more of altimetry\\'s 10-20-day variance in the Southern Ocean than the original DAC model did, 5%-10% more in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, and is functionally equivalent in the Equatorial Pacific. The removal of the additional sub-Nyquist-frequency signals will result in better Jason altimetry data with fewer aliased signals incorrectly propagated to longer periods.\\nC1 [Bonin, J.

The proposed theory is based on the multilayer quasigeostrophic framework, which is reduced to a system governed by a single nonlinear prognostic equation for the upper layer. The dynamics of deeper layers are represented by linear diagnostic relations. A major role in the statistical equilibration of baroclinic instability is played by the latent zonally elongated modes. These structures form spontaneously in baroclinically unstable systems and effectively suppress the amplification of primary unstable modes. Special attention is given to the effects of bottom friction, which is shown to control both linear and nonlinear properties of baroclinic instability. The reduced-dynamics model is validated by a series of numerical simulations.\\nC1 [Radko, Timour] Naval Postgrad Sch, Dept Oceanog, Monterey, CA 93943 USA.\\n   [McWilliams, James C.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Los Angeles, CA USA.\\n   [Sutyrin, Georgi G.] Univ Rhode Isl, Grad Sch Oceanog, Narragansett, RI USA.\\nRP Radko, T (通讯作者)，Naval Postgrad Sch, Dept Oceanog, Monterey, CA 93943 USA.\\nEM tradko@nps.edu\\nFU National Science Foundation [OCE 1828843]\\nFX Acknowledgments.The authors thank the editor Paola Cessi and the\\n   anonymous reviewers for helpful comments.

Upper ocean (5-70 m) temperature, salinity, and velocity profiles were measured at sub-kilometer horizontal resolution along the 800-1800-km-long cruise tracks. We find that beneath the river water, density stratification at 5-15 m depth can be 10 times stronger than typically seen in much of the subtropical or tropical ocean. The shallow salinity-dominated stratification suppresses shear-induced turbulence, thereby \"trapping\" momentum input from monsoon winds in the uppermost 20 m of the ocean. Estimates of directly wind-forced ocean currents are consistent with Ekman depth scaling as 1/N0f $1/\\\\sqrt{{N}_{0}f}$, where N-0 is stratification at the base of the mixed layer and f is Coriolis frequency. In the presence of river water, cruise-mean wind-forced currents resemble tightly surface trapped Ekman-like spirals: The shallowest measured current at 5 m depth has a speed of nearly 0.2 m/s, directed 80 degrees to the right of the wind. Outside the pool of river water, wind momentum penetrates to 40 m depth.\\nC1 [Chaudhuri, Dipanjan; Sengupta, Debasis] Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.\\n   [Chaudhuri, Dipanjan; D\\'Asaro, Eric] Univ Washington, Appl Phys Lab, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.\\n   [Sengupta, Debasis] Indian Inst Sci, Divecha Ctr Climate Change, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.\\n   [Shivaprasad, S.] Govt India, Indian Natl Ctr Ocean Informat Serv, Minist Earth Sci, Hyderabad, India.\\nRP Chaudhuri, D (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.; Chaudhuri, D (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Appl Phys Lab, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.\\nEM dipadadachaudhuri@gmail.com\\nOI Chaudhuri, Dipanjan/0000-0003-4394-1567\\nFU Ministry of Earth Sciences, New Delhi; Indian Institute of Tropical\\n   Meteorology, Pune [MM/2014/IND002]; Divecha Centre For Climate Change,\\n   Bangalore; INCOIS; National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT)\\nFX The authors acknowledge the Ministry of Earth Sciences, New Delhi and\\n   the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune for support under the\\n   National Monsoon Mission project, grant MM/2014/IND002.

The estimated amplitude of the climatological diurnal LHF over the Indo-Pacific warm pool and the equatorial Pacific and Atlantic cold tongues is remarkable, with maximum values exceeding 20.0 W m(-2). Diurnal variability of sea surface skin temperature (SSTskin) is the primary contributor to the diurnal LHF amplitude. Because the diurnal SSTskin amplitude has an inverse relationship with surface wind speed over the tropical oceans, an inverse spatial pattern between the diurnal LHF amplitude and surface wind speed results. Resolving diurnal variations in the SSTskin and wind improves the estimate of the climatological LHF by properly capturing the daytime SSTskin and daily mean wind speed, respectively. The diurnal SSTskin-associated contribution is large over the warm pool and equatorial cold tongues where low wind speeds tend to cause strong diurnal SSTskin warming, while the magnitude associated with the diurnal winds is large over the highly dynamic environment of the intertropical convergence zone. The total diurnal contribution is about 9.0 W m(-2) on average over the buoy sites. There appears to be a power function (linear) relationship between the diurnal SSTskin-associated (wind-associated) contribution and surface mean wind speed (wind speed enhancement from diurnal variability). The total contribution from diurnal variability can be estimated accurately from high-frequency surface wind measurements using these relationships.\\nC1 [Yan, Yunwei] Minist Nat Resources, State Key Lab Satellite Ocean Environm Dynam, Inst Oceanog 2, Hangzhou, Peoples R China.\\n   [Yan, Yunwei] Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab Zhuhai, Zhuhai, Peoples R China.\\n   [Zhang, Lei] Univ Colorado, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.\\n   [Song, Xiangzhou] Hohai Univ, Key Lab Marine Hazards Forecasting, Minist Nat Resources, Nanjing, Peoples R China.\\n   [Song, Xiangzhou] Hohai Univ, Coll Oceanog, Nanjing, Peoples R China.\\n   [Wang, Guihua; Chen, Changlin] Fudan Univ, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China.\\n   [Wang, Guihua; Chen, Changlin] Fudan Univ, Inst Atmospher Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China.\\nRP Yan, YW (通讯作者)，Minist Nat Resources, State Key Lab Satellite Ocean Environm Dynam, Inst Oceanog 2, Hangzhou, Peoples R China.; Yan, YW (通讯作者)，Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab Zhuhai, Zhuhai, Peoples R China.; Chen, CL (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China.; Chen, CL (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, Inst Atmospher Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China.\\nEM yanyunwei@sio.org.cn; chencl@fudan.edu.cn\\nOI Yan, Yunwei/0000-0003-3196-741X\\nFU National Natural Science Foundation of China [41976028, 42122040,\\n   41976003]\\nFX This study is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of\\n   China (Grants 41976028, 42122040, and 41976003).\\nNR 47\\nTC 2\\nZ9 2\\nU1 9\\nU2 9\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA\\nSN 0022-3670\\nEI 1520-0485\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

In total, we examined scales from 2604 individuals from 5 stocks over 7 outmigration years characterized by a range of survival conditions (range from 0.11 to 9.50%). We observed a positive relationship between growth during the first year at sea and survival for adults returning to Puget Sound and the Washington coast. Scale growth during the first year at sea did not co-vary between coastal Washington and Puget Sound stocks, and in most years coastal Chinook salmon attained a larger size at the end of the first year at sea. Large scale oceanographic variables (PDO, NPGO) were not significantly related to variation in scale growth, but for some Puget Sound populations, scale growth was higher in years of cooler sea surface temperatures and lower Pink salmon (O. gorbuscha) abundance. We developed a biological indicator for forecasting cohort survival of Tumwater Falls hatchery Chinook salmon on the Deschutes River, WA using marine growth estimates of the earliest returning fish (age-21). The marine growth index predicted survival better for 8 brood years compared to a recent 5 year average returns forecasting approach (3.40% vs 35.41% Mean Percent Error). Results from this study suggest that early marine growth is important to the survival of Puget Sound and coastal Washington Chinook salmon and may be a useful biological indicator to improve pre-season forecasting of Chinook salmon populations in Washington State.\\nC1 [Claiborne, Andrew M.; Campbell, Lance; Stevick, Bethany; Losee, James P.; Litz, Marisa; Anderson, Joseph H.] Washington Dept Fish & Wildlife, 1111 Washington St SE, Olympia, WA 98501 USA.\\n   [Sandell, Todd] Washington Dept Fish & Wildlife, 16018 Mill Creek Blvd, Mill Creek, WA 98012 USA.\\nRP Claiborne, AM (通讯作者)，Washington Dept Fish & Wildlife, 1111 Washington St SE, Olympia, WA 98501 USA.\\nEM Andrew.Claiborne@dfw.wa.gov\\nFU Pacific Salmon Commission\\'s Southern Endowment Fund via Long Live the\\n   Kings\\nFX This is Publication Number 31 from the Salish Sea Marine Survival\\n   Project: an international, collaborative research effort designed to\\n   determine the primary factors affecting the survival of juvenile salmon\\n   and steelhead survival in the combined waters of Puget Sound and Strait\\n   of Georgia (marinesurvivalproject.com ) .

Luhar et al. (2010, suggested that this mean current is analogous to the streaming flow generated in wave boundary layers over bare beds, and developed a simple energy and momentum balance model to predict its magnitude. However, this model predicts that the magnitude of the mean current does not depend on canopy spatial density, which is inconsistent with the measurements made by Abdolahpour et al. (2017, in recent laboratory experiments. Motivated by observations that the wave-driven mean flow is most pronounced at the canopy interface, Abdolahpour et al. (2017, proposed an alternate explanation for its origin: It is driven by the vertical heterogeneity in orbital motion created by canopy drag. Such heterogeneity can give rise to incomplete particle orbits near the canopy interface and a Lagrangian mean current analogous to Stokes drift in the direction of wave propagation. A model guided by this physical insight and dimensional analysis is able to generate much more accurate predictions. This comment aims to reconcile these two different models for the wave-driven mean flow in submerged canopies.\\nC1 [Luhar, Mitul] Univ Southern Calif, Dept Aerosp & Mech Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA.\\nRP Luhar, M (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Calif, Dept Aerosp & Mech Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA.\\nEM luhar@usc.edu\\nOI Luhar, Mitul/0000-0002-7970-9762\\nNR 15\\nTC 2\\nZ9 2\\nU1 0\\nU2 0\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

This has limited our ability to fully understand seasonal cycles and transformations of the Chukchi Sea zooplankton, particularly the key copepod species Calanus glacialis. Abundance and distributions of large zooplankton and of all life stages of C. glacialis in the northeastern Chukchi Sea during May-June 2014 are described. Three main zooplankton communities are identified; \"arctic oceanic\" along the Chukchi slope associated with off-shelf water masses; Chukchi Sea \"overwintering\" associated with cold winter water in the northern part of the study area; and Chukchi Sea \"spring\" associated with early season summer water in the southern portion of the study area. The overwintering and spring communities were distinguished by the near total absence of younger copepodid (CI-CIII) C. glacialis stages and meroplankton in the overwintering community while older (CV-adult) C. glacialis, amphipods, and chaetognaths were present in both. The distributions of the communities followed the major circulation pathways in the northeastern Chukchi Sea. Water and plankton flooding in from the northern Bering Sea was filling the Chukchi Sea and replenishing the zooplankton communities as the remnants of the overwintering community was being advected northwards and into the Canadian Basin. A conceptual model of the seasonal evolution of C. glacialis populations in the Chukchi Sea, based on the interaction of C. glacialis phenology and advective drivers, enfolds both these spring observations and summer observations from numerous previous studies. Because the flushing time of the Chukchi Sea is shorter than the C. glacialis generation time, the copepod is unable to establish an endemic population in the Chukchi Sea, hence the population there must be renewed annually from the northern Bering Sea.\\nC1 [Ashjian, Carin J.; Pickart, Robert S.; Alatalo, Philip] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, MS 33,266 Woods Hole Rd, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\n   [Campbell, Robert G.; Gelfman, Cecilia] Univ Rhode Isl, Narragansett, RI 02882 USA.\\n   [Feng, Zhixuan] East China Normal Univ, Sch Marine Sci, State Key Lab Estuarine & Coastal Res, Shanghai, Peoples R China.\\n   [Zhang, Jinlun] Univ Washington, Appl Phys Lab, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.\\nRP Ashjian, CJ (通讯作者)，Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, MS 33,266 Woods Hole Rd, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\nEM cashjian@whoi.edu\\nFU Crew of the USCGC Healy; Andrew W.

This variability has regular phase patterns consistent with freely propagating barotropic Rossby waves radiating energy away from the unstable equatorial currents, and the waves clearly propagate from the equatorial region to at least 30 degrees N. The pattern of SSH variance at TIW frequencies exhibits remarkable patchiness on scales of hundreds of kilometers, which we interpret as being due to the combined effects of wave reflection, refraction, and interference. North of 40 degrees N, more than 6000 km from the unstable equatorial currents, the SSH field remains coherent with the near-equatorial SSH variability, but it is not as clear whether the variability at the higher latitudes is a simple result of barotropic wave radiation from the tropical instability waves. Even more distant regions, as far north as the Aleutian Islands off of Alaska and the Kamchatka Peninsula of eastern Russia, have SSH variability that is significantly coherent with the near-equatorial instabilities. The variability is not well represented in the widely used gridded SSH data product commonly referred to as the AVISO or DUACS product, and this appears to be a result of spatial variations in the filtering properties of the objective mapping scheme.\\nC1 [Farrar, J.

We review the history, research, and application of the Rockfish Recruitment and Ecosystem Assessment Survey, highlighting how one survey of life can illuminate understanding of pelagic biodiversity patterns and ecosystem function (from micronekton to upper trophic level predators to ecosystem services) that may be easily extended to other surveys to strengthen observation networks. Biodiversity is often used as the standard for understanding ecosystem resilience to climate or anthropogenic disturbances. This concept is central to our review, and we examine it in relation to complex impacts resulting from a recent climate event (a marine heatwave) on biodiversity, ecosystem function, and socioeconomic services. We present a system of interconnected modules that summarize and illustrate patterns of pelagic biodiversity using a phylogenetic approach, known modulations and environmental drivers of variability (i.e., source waters, habitat compression, and ecosystem shifts), remote sensing and modeling tools for monitoring biodiversity (i.e., seascapes and krill hotspot models), and the status of top predator diversity. We use these modules to summarize connections between biodiversity and ecosystem services provided. Following each module, a brief discussion of questions raised and recommendations for future studies and partnerships is provided to improve future integrative biodiversity monitoring. Additionally, we invested in promoting data accessibility and outreach, resulting in several data visualization and ecosystem context tools for biodiversity monitoring and fisheries management. We advocate that a diverse integrated ecosystem approach should result in fewer ecological surprises by putting past events and surprises into context, and thus better anticipating those yet to arrive. Building partnerships among researchers and coastal communities will result in increased capacity of analytical tools and perspectives to ensure sustainable use of fishery resources, while strengthening the resilience of fishing communities.\\nC1 [Santora, Jarrod A.; Miller, Rebecca R.; Sakuma, Keith M.; Wells, Brian K.; Field, John C.] NOAA, Fisheries Ecol Div, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr SWFSC, NMFS, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA.\\n   [Santora, Jarrod A.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz UCSC, Dept Appl Math, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.\\n   [Schroeder, Isaac D.] NOAA, Div Environm Res, SWFSC, NMFS, Monterey, CA USA.\\n   [Schroeder, Isaac D.; Cimino, Megan A.; Miller, Rebecca R.] UCSC, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Cruz, CA USA.\\n   [Bograd, Steven J.] NOAA, Climate & Ecosyst Environm Res Div, Monterey, CA USA.\\n   [Chavez, Francisco P.] Monterey Bay Aquarium Res Inst MBARI, Moss Landing, CA USA.\\n   [Cimino, Megan A.; Hazen, Elliott L.] NOAA, Div Environm Res, SWFSC, NMFS, Monterey, CA USA.\\n   [Fiechter, Jerome] UCSC, Dept Ocean Sci, Santa Cruz, CA USA.\\n   [Kavanaugh, Maria T.] Oregon State Univ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.\\n   [Messie, Monique] MBARI, Moss Landing, CA USA.\\n   [Sydeman, William J.] Farallon Inst, Petaluma, CA USA.\\nRP Santora, JA (通讯作者)，NOAA, Fisheries Ecol Div, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr SWFSC, NMFS, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA.; Santora, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Cruz UCSC, Dept Appl Math, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.\\nEM jarrod.santora@noaa.gov\\nRI Messié, Monique/AGO-6508-2022\\nOI Messié, Monique/0000-0002-4985-3413\\nFU US Marine Biodiversity Observation Network - NOAA [80NSSC20M0001]; US\\n   Marine Biodiversity Observation Network - NASA [80NSSC20M0001]; US\\n   Marine Biodiversity Observation Network - National Oceanographic\\n   Partnership Program [80NSSC20M0001]; Interdisciplinary Science NASA\\n   ROSES Program Life in a Moving Ocean [80NSSC17K0574]\\nFX We acknowledge and thank the many institutions that have invested in\\n   supporting and maintaining longterm ecosystem monitoring.

The abyssal water-mass, the Lower Circumpolar Deep Water (LCDW), is captured. After crossing the Yap Mariana Junction, the LCDW spreads to the Parece Vela Basin, the southern part of the Shikoku Basin, the Minami-Daito Basin, and the northern Philippine Basin, with its upper interface sinking from similar to 4,000 m to similar to 5,000 m. Blocked by the Central Basin Fault, the LCDW cannot penetrate further southward into the southern Philippine Basin. An abyssal current across the Kyushu-Palau Ridge connecting the eastern and western parts of the Philippine Sea is identified at 22.5 degrees N-29.5 degrees N, which is suggested to be the main branch transporting LCDW from the Yap Mariana Junction westward into the northern Philippine Basin. Synoptic analysis of hydrographic observations suggests the existence of a cyclonic circulation in the abyssal Philippine Sea. During 1990-2020, a warming trend of 0.33 +/- 0.19 x 10(-3)degrees C yr(-1) is identified at depths below 2,000 m, while a SiO2 maximum core at 30 degrees N implies a possible cooling of the Mixed Deep Water (more influenced by North Pacific Deep Water) in the Philippine Sea. Under 4,000 m, freshening together with warming south of 20 degrees N indicate contraction of LCDW after entering the Yap Mariana Junction.\\nC1 [Tian, Zichen; Zhou, Chun; Xiao, Xin; Wang, Tinghao; Yang, Qingxuan; Zhao, Wei; Tian, Jiwei] Ocean Univ China, Sanya Oceanog Inst, Inst Adv Ocean Study, Phys Oceanog Lab, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China.\\n   [Tian, Zichen; Zhou, Chun; Xiao, Xin; Wang, Tinghao; Yang, Qingxuan; Zhao, Wei; Tian, Jiwei] Pilot Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol Qingdao, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China.\\n   [Qu, Tangdong] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Joint Inst Reg Earth Syst Sci & Engn, Los Angeles, CA USA.\\nRP Zhou, C (通讯作者)，Ocean Univ China, Sanya Oceanog Inst, Inst Adv Ocean Study, Phys Oceanog Lab, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China.; Zhou, C (通讯作者)，Pilot Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol Qingdao, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China.\\nEM chunzhou@ouc.edu.cn\\nOI Xin, Xiao/0000-0001-7580-4140; Zhou, Chun/0000-0002-3989-5943; Tian,\\n   Zichen/0000-0002-7598-6332\\nFU National Natural Science Foundation of China [91858203, 42076027,\\n   91958205, 41606014]; Hainan Provincial Joint Project of Sanya Yazhou Bay\\n   Science and Technology City [120LH059]; Global Change and Air-Sea\\n   Interaction Project [GASI-IPOVAI-01-03, GASI-IPOVAI-01-02]\\nFX This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of\\n   China (91858203, 42076027, 91958205, and 41606014), the Hainan\\n   Provincial Joint Project of Sanya Yazhou Bay Science and Technology City\\n   (120LH059), the Global Change and Air-Sea Interaction Project\\n   (GASI-IPOVAI-01-03, and GASI-IPOVAI-01-02).

Although relatively common in continental margins, chemosynthetic communities in the Caribbean region are poorly known. Their existence in Colombian waters has been suggested by the presence of carbonates and specimens of seep- specialist families obtained through trawling surveys, and seismic and multibeam data. Habitat models incorporating bathymetry and backscatter data have also predicted the presence of hard ground areas (presumed authigenic carbonates formed due to chemosynthetic activity), which are consistent with water column plume anomalies. Here, we present the first characterization of the megafauna found in cold-seep communities in the Colombian Caribbean between 2300 and 3300 m using seafloor images taken with a towed camera system and samples collected through piston coring. Chemosynthetic communities at these sites resemble those found off Trinidad and Tobago and the Gulf of Mexico. Dominant species include tubeworms (Lamellabranchia sp. and Escarpia sp.), mussels (Bathymodiolus sp.), shrimp (Alvinocaris sp.), and squat lobsters (Munidopsis sp.). These results represent foundational knowledge of deep-sea ecosystems in the southern Caribbean.\\nC1 [Duenas, Luisa F.] Univ Nacl Colombia, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol, Sede Bogota, Carrera 45 26-85, Bogota, Colombia.\\n   [Duenas, Luisa F.; Puentes, Vladimir; Leon, Jorge] Anadarko Colombia Co, Calle 113 7-80 Piso 11, Bogota, Colombia.\\n   [Herrera, Santiago] Lehigh Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 111 Res Dr, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA.\\nRP Herrera, S (通讯作者)，Lehigh Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 111 Res Dr, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA.\\nEM sherrera@alum.mit.edu\\nRI Herrera, Santiago/E-5953-2011\\nOI Herrera, Santiago/0000-0001-7204-9434; Puentes,\\n   Vladimir/0000-0002-8796-1810\\nFU Colciencias Post-Doctoral Program (Fondo Nacional de Financiamiento para\\n   la Ciencia, la tecnologia y la innovacion \"Francisco Jose de Caldas\")\\n   [784]\\nFX The samples and image data analyzed in this study was obtained through\\n   exploration activities by Anadarko Colombia Company (ACC), a subsidiary\\n   of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC), which was acquired by\\n   Occidental Petroleum on Aug. 8, 2019.

Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis has long been used to explore variability in physical processes, but has been only recently employed to study variability in biological processes. EOF analysis estimates dominant modes of variability (indices) and produces maps representing the spatial response for the dependent variable to each of these indices. In the eastern Bering Sea (EBS), research has linked demographic processes to the spatial extent of bottom temperatures less than or equal to 2 degrees C (the \"cold-pool extent\" or \"CPE\"), but has generally not compared effects among different demographic processes. We applied EOF analysis to four types of data measuring the outcome of demographic processes for EBS walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) over the period 1982-2019: numerical density (outcome of movement), morphometric condition (outcome of bioenergetics), length-at-age (outcome of growth), and prey-biomass-per-predator-mass (a proxy for stomach contents; outcome of consumption). We first designed exploratory factor analysis (EFA) models that did not include a CPE effect. We then applied confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), which differed from EFA by attributing observed patterns to a spatially varying response of demographic processes to CPE. We inferred that CPE was a proxy for demographic variability when there was a strong correlation between (1) the first or second mode of variability in the EFA and CPE or (2) the spatial map associated with the positive phase of the first or second mode of variability from the EFA model and the spatially varying response of CPE from the CFA model. Results showed that prey-biomass-per-predator-mass had the strongest correlation with CPE, numerical density and morphometric condition were also strongly correlated with CPE, and length-at-age was moderately correlated with CPE. The models also identified several anomalous years: 1999 and 2010, which were characterized by a very large CPE and high indices for variables related to demographic processes; and 2016-2019, which were characterized by a small CPE and low indices for variables related to demographic processes. We conclude that demographic processes for EBS walleye pollock show the finger-print of bottom-up environmental variation. Future research can employ CPE projections to forecast spatio-temporal changes in variables related to demographic processes, thereby informing estimates such as weight-at-age that are used in stock assessment models.\\nC1 [Gruss, Arnaud; Rohan, Sean K.] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, 1122 NE Boat St,Box 355020, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.\\n   [Gruss, Arnaud] Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, 301 Evans Bay Parade, Wellington 6021, New Zealand.\\n   [Thorson, James T.] NOAA, Habitat & Ecol Proc Res Program, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.\\n   [Stawitz, Christine C.] NOAA, Natl Stock Assessment Program, Off Sci & Technol, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 1315 East West Blvd, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA.\\n   [Reum, Jonathan C.

Across the Arabian Sea, these outflows impact human and biological activities, their thermohaline characteristics and shapes exhibiting important spatial and seasonal variability. The knowledge of the water masses properties is important to validate realistic simulations of the Indian Ocean. A classical approach to study these water masses is to track them on specific isopycnal levels. Nevertheless, their peaking thermohaline characteristics are not always found at a specific density but rather spread over a range. Here, we develop a detection algorithm able to capture the full vertical structure of the outflows, that we applied to a data set of about 126,000 vertical profiles. We are thus able to quantify the changes in their thermohaline signatures and in their vertical structures, characterized here by the intensity of the salinity peaks of the water masses and lateral injection of fresh and salty waters, and describe their spatial variability. Across the northwestern Indian Ocean, the salty outflows undergo several changes, diminishing their thermohaline signatures and peaks and layering. In their early stages in the narrow Gulf of Oman and Aden, the outflows present configurations indicative of diapycnal mixing. In the same regions and along the western edge of the Arabian Sea, these water masses are subject to lateral mixing. All over the Arabian Sea, salt fingering conditions are met for lower layers of the outflows.\\n   Plain Language Summary In the northwestern Indian Ocean, water masses with different characteristics are measured. Two of them are some of the most salty found globally, namely Persian Gulf Water and Red Sea Water. In the Arabian Sea, these outflows transport salt and heat, affecting the biological activity. Furthermore, the knowledge of such quantities is necessary to simulate the circulation of the basin. A classical approach to analyze the characteristics of these outflows is to measure them at specific densities. It has been observed that peaks in salinity are more often found over a range of densities, rather than at specific values. In this study, we develop a detection algorithm able to capture the full vertical structure of the outflows. Thus, we quantify the temperature and salinity regional distribution of the outflows, and describe their vertical configurations. Along their paths, the salty outflows undergo several changes in their vertical structures, with a diminution of their peaks in salinity and lateral injections of saltier and fresher waters, particularly near their straits of exit. Finally, all over the Arabian Sea, the outflows are in salt fingering conditions, losing salt at smaller vertical scales.\\nC1 [L\\'Hegaret, Pierre; de Marez, Charly; Morvan, Mathieu; Carton, Xavier] Technopole Brest Iroise, Lab Oceanog Phys & Spatiale LOPS, IUEM, Plouzane, France.\\n   [Meunier, Thomas] Ensenada Ctr Sci Res & Higher Educ, CICESE, Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico.\\n   [L\\'Hegaret, Pierre] Ecole Normale Super, Lab Meteorol Dynam, IPSL, Paris, France.\\n   [Morvan, Mathieu] Serv Hydrograph & Oceanograph Marine, SHOM, Brest 2, France.\\n   [Meunier, Thomas] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Falmouth, MA USA.\\nRP L\\'Hegaret, P (通讯作者)，Technopole Brest Iroise, Lab Oceanog Phys & Spatiale LOPS, IUEM, Plouzane, France.; L\\'Hegaret, P (通讯作者)，Ecole Normale Super, Lab Meteorol Dynam, IPSL, Paris, France.\\nEM pierre.lhegaret@outlook.fr\\nRI carton, xavier j/A-1895-2016\\nOI Meunier, Thomas/0000-0002-9465-0113; L\\'Hegaret,\\n   Pierre/0000-0003-3873-9006\\nFU NOAA OAR Ocean Observing and Monitoring Division\\nFX The authors thank the World Ocean Database (WOD), a collection of\\n   scientifically quality-controlled ocean profile data, an NCEI product\\n   and an International Oceanographic Data and Information Exchange (IODE)\\n   project, funded in partnership with the NOAA OAR Ocean Observing and\\n   Monitoring Division.;\\nNR 77\\nTC 1\\nZ9 1\\nU1 4\\nU2 7\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

The goals of this technique are to remove oil from surface waters in order to reduce exposure of surface-dwelling organisms, to keep oil slicks from impacting sensitive shorelines, and to protect responders from volatile organic compounds. During the Deepwater Horizon response, unprecedented volumes of dispersants (Corexit 9500 and 9527) were both sprayed on surface slicks from airplanes and applied directly at the wellhead (similar to 1,500 m water depth). A decade of research followed, leading to a deeper understanding of dispersant effectiveness, fate, and effects. These studies resulted in new knowledge regarding dispersant formulations, efficacy, and effects on organisms and processes at a broad range of exposure levels, and about potential environmental and human impacts. Future studies should focus on the application of high volumes of dispersants subsea and the long-term fate and effects of dispersants and dispersed oil. In considering effects, the research and applications of the knowledge gained should go beyond concerns for acute toxicity and consider sublethal impacts at all levels of biological organization. Contingency planning for the use of dispersants during oil spill response should consider more deeply the temporal duration, effectiveness (especially of subsurface applications), spatial reach, and volume applied.\\nC1 [Quigg, Antonietta] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Marine Biol, Galveston, TX 77553 USA.\\n   [Farrington, John W.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Marine Chem & Geochem Dept, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\n   [Gilbert, Sherryl] Univ S Florida, C IMAGE Consortium, St Petersburg, FL USA.\\n   [Murawski, Steven A.] Univ S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, St Petersburg, FL USA.\\n   [John, Vijay T.] Tulane Univ, Sch Sci & Engn, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.\\nRP Quigg, A (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Marine Biol, Galveston, TX 77553 USA.\\nEM quigga@tamug.edu\\nFU Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative; GoMRI\\nFX The authors gratefully acknowledge support from the Gulf of Mexico\\n   Research Initiative.

Here, we observe internal tides propagating into the North Equatorial Countercurrent during two spatial surveys near a submarine ridge. On the second survey during a diurnal spring tide, we note elevated shear upstream of the ridge below 112 m with corresponding low Richardson numbers, which suggests the internal waves are dissipating due to shear instability. Reduced amplitudes are noted above 150 m. Internal tidal motions were isolated by performing a phase average over a wavelength upstream of the topography. Momentum flux convergence and divergence are noted upstream of the ridge, have a similar magnitude to mean flow acceleration terms, and are about 10% of the largest mean flow terms. The internal tides were noted upstream and appeared weaker downstream, but due to the topographic wake similar calculations could not be performed downstream. Tall, steep topography and strong equatorial currents are found throughout the low-latitude western Pacific, which suggests such infrequently observed internal tide flux divergences may be commonly contributing to the momentum of mean flows.\\nC1 [Johnston, T.

Formally, turbulent dispersion of a passive tracer by surface waves is a Brownian motion caused by a prescribed noise, viz., random fluctuations of the wave field. From this perspective, it is similar to the conventional dispersion by tracer particles by turbulent flows initially described in the seminal work of Richardson, Taylor and Obukhov. The additional challenges of this problem are imposed by the complexity of the underlining wave field-different dispersion relations and correlation structure, directionality and its spread, wave breaking-and this complexity necessitates further theoretical and experimental research. The aim of the present study is experimental validation of scaling relations for the mean drift and mean variance of tracer particles predicted by the wave turbulence theory. We report results of a set of targeted experiments in a large three-dimensional wave tank where the positions of the tracer particles-modelled as surface drifters-were tracked down with optical cameras. The experimental data are analysed and discussed in the light of the weak turbulence theory.\\nC1 [Violante-Carvalho, Nelson; Pereira, Henrique; Esperanca, Paulo T.

Advanced satellite algorithms can be used to estimate PSCs and to integrate the results of biogeochemical research and theoretical studies. Analysis of an extensive dataset of pigment concentrations measured via high-performance liquid chromatography in the southern Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and South China Sea revealed that nanophytoplankton made important contributions to phytoplankton biomass and that sea surface temperature (SST) was the key environmental factor associated with variations of PSCs. A regional SST-dependent, abundance-based model was then tuned to estimate the PSCs and was found to be more effective than the SST-independent model in capturing the temporal trends in PSCs. The implication is that dynamic PSCs variations may be underestimated by using SST-independent, abundance-based model parameters in marginal seas. Moreover, the logistic \"S-shape\" dependence of PSCs model parameters on SST suggested that global warming may affect PSCs differently on continental shelves in marginal seas or other middle-latitude regions. Application of this PSCs model to satellite data from 2002 to 2017 revealed the temporal and spatial distributions of the PSCs in these marginal seas. We investigated seasonal climatological variations of PSCs in thirteen representative regional areas, including estuaries, upwelling areas, shelves, slopes, and basins. The results were consistent with in situ investigations but provided more high-resolution information. Wind, irradiance, and temperature were found to be important determinants of PSCs variations.\\nC1 [Liu, Haoran; Liu, Xin; Xiao, Wupeng; Huang, Bangqin] Xiamen Univ, State Key Lab Marine Environm Sci, Fujian Prov Key Lab Coastal Ecol & Environm Studi, Coll Environm & Ecol, Xiamen, Peoples R China.\\n   [Laws, Edward A.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Coll Coast & Environm, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.\\nRP Liu, X (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, State Key Lab Marine Environm Sci, Fujian Prov Key Lab Coastal Ecol & Environm Studi, Coll Environm & Ecol, Xiamen, Peoples R China.\\nEM liuxin1983@xmu.edu.cn\\nRI Liu, Xin/D-6312-2019\\nOI Liu, Xin/0000-0002-7925-9618; Huang, Bangqin/0000-0003-2279-6241\\nFU National Key R&D Program of China [2016YFA0601201, 2017YFC1404402];\\n   National Natural Science Foundation of China [41776146, U1805241,\\n   41890803]; National Postdoctoral Program for Innovative Talents\\n   [BX20190185]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2019M660158];\\n   Outstanding Postdoctoral Scholarship, State Key Laboratory of Marine\\n   Environmental Science, Xiamen University; Xiamen University Presidential\\n   Fund [20720180102]; Programme of Introducing Talents of Discipline to\\n   Universities (\"111\" Project) [BP0719030]; NSFC Ship time Sharing Project\\nFX This work was supported by grants from the National Key R&D Program of\\n   China (2016YFA0601201 and 2017YFC1404402), the National Natural Science\\n   Foundation of China (41776146, U1805241 and 41890803), the National\\n   Postdoctoral Program for Innovative Talents (BX20190185), the China\\n   Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2019M660158).

The surface-to-subsurface structure of the KE front averaged over 142 degrees-165 degrees E has shifted poleward at a rate of similar to 0.23 degrees +/- 0.16 degrees decade(-1). The shift was caused mainly by the poleward shift of the downstream KE front (153 degrees-165 degrees E, similar to 0.41 degrees +/- 0.29 degrees decade(-1)) and barely by the upstream KE front (142 degrees-153 degrees E). The long-term shift trend of the KE front showed two distinct behaviors before and after 2002. Before 2002, the surface KE front moved northward with a faster rate than the subsurface. After 2002, the surface KE front showed no obvious trend, but the subsurface KE front continued to move northward. The ventilation zone of the STMW, defined by the area between the 16 degrees and 18 degrees C isotherms or between the 25 and 25.5 kg m(-3) isopycnals, contracted and displaced northward with a shoaling of the mixed layer depth h(m) before 2002 when the KE front moved northward. The STMW subduction rate was reduced by 0.76 Sv (63%; 1 Sv equivalent to = 10(6) m(3) s(-1)) during 1979-2018, most of which occurred before 2002. Of the three components affecting the total subduction rate, the temporal induction (-partial derivative h(m)/partial derivative t) was dominant accounting for 91% of the rate reduction, while the vertical pumping (-w(mb)) amounted to 8% and the lateral induction (-u(mb) . del h(m)) was insignificant. The reduced temporal induction was attributed to both the contracted ventilation zone and the shallowed h(m) that were incurred by the poleward shift of KE front.\\nC1 [Wu, Baolan; Lin, Xiaopei] Ocean Univ China, Frontier Sci Ctr Deep Ocean Multispheres & Earth, Qingdao, Peoples R China.\\n   [Wu, Baolan; Lin, Xiaopei] Ocean Univ China, Phys Oceanog Lab, Qingdao, Peoples R China.\\n   [Wu, Baolan; Lin, Xiaopei] Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Qingdao, Peoples R China.\\n   [Wu, Baolan; Yu, Lisan] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Phys Oceanog, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\nRP Lin, XP (通讯作者)，Ocean Univ China, Frontier Sci Ctr Deep Ocean Multispheres & Earth, Qingdao, Peoples R China.; Lin, XP (通讯作者)，Ocean Univ China, Phys Oceanog Lab, Qingdao, Peoples R China.; Lin, XP (通讯作者)，Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Qingdao, Peoples R China.\\nEM linxiaop@ouc.edu.cn\\nFU National Natural Science Foundation of China [41925025, 92058203];\\n   China\\'s national key research and development projects [2016YFA0601803];\\n   China Scholarship Council [201806330010]\\nFX This study benefited from discussions with Young-Oh Kwon.

In the summers of 2015-2018, we examined the distribution of phytoplankton photophysiological properties across two contrasting regions of the Arctic Ocean with distinctly different levels of nitrogen availability in the upper water column. We quantified the extent of nitrogen stress using a highly sensitive fluorescence induction and relaxation system to obtain continuous underway measurements and via discrete sample analyses of phytoplankton physiology, as well as nutrient enrichment incubations. The results revealed vast regions in the Chukchi Sea where phytoplankton photosynthesis was severely nitrogen-stressed. Thereby, the maximum quantum yield of photochemistry in photosystem II showed only a small decrease (12 +/- 9%) relative to its nutrient-replete values, while the maximum photosynthetic electron transport rates under saturating irradiance were impaired to a greater extent (40 +/- 17%). This phytoplankton photosynthesis response is indicative of a severe nitrogen limitation, which results in dramatic reduction in growth and net primary production rates. Nutrient enrichment incubations also revealed a marked increase in large-size phytoplankton growth (>10 mu m) after the nitrogen stress was alleviated, suggesting that the larger cells were more susceptible to nitrogen stress. These results are important for understanding how regional nitrogen fluxes control variability in the primary production and phytoplankton community structure and how these processes might change with rapid climate changes in the Arctic Ocean.\\nC1 [Ko, Eunho; Jung, Jinyoung; Joo, Hyoung Min; Lee, Youngju; Cho, Kyoung-Ho; Yang, Eun Jin; Kang, Sung-Ho; Park, Jisoo] Korea Polar Res Inst, Div Polar Ocean Sci, Incheon, South Korea.\\n   [Ko, Eunho; Park, Jisoo] Univ Sci & Technol, Daejeon, South Korea.\\n   [Gorbunov, Maxim Y.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Marine & Coastal Sci, New Brunswick, NJ USA.\\nRP Park, J (通讯作者)，Korea Polar Res Inst, Div Polar Ocean Sci, Incheon, South Korea.; Park, J (通讯作者)，Univ Sci & Technol, Daejeon, South Korea.\\nEM jspark@kopri.re.kr\\nOI Park, Jisoo/0000-0003-0428-8358; Yang, Eun Jin/0000-0002-8639-5968\\nNR 83\\nTC 9\\nZ9 9\\nU1 4\\nU2 15\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

Over all, the New England Seamounts east from Retriever to Nashville have a more diverse megabenthic fauna than Corner Rise, but the lowest diversity was observed on the three seamounts located closest to the continental margin. The megabenthic assemblage structure varies both within and across seamounts, and hierarchical cluster analysis revealed groups dependent on location (as measured by longitude) and depth, with substrate composition an additional but less significant factor at the regional scale.

Across the 10-year time series, temporal means and interannual and intra-annual variability are used to quantify the variability of spatial surface current patterns. The 10-year annual mean surface flows are weaker and mostly cross-shelf near the coast, increasing in speed and rotating to more alongshore directions near the shelfbreak, and increasing in speed and rotating to flow off-shelf in the southern MAB. The annual mean surface current pattern is relatively stable year to year compared to the hourly variations within a year. The 10-year seasonal means exhibit similar current patterns, with winter and summer more cross-shore while spring and fall transitions are more alongshore. Fall and winter mean speeds are larger and correspond to when mean winds are stronger and cross-shore. Summer mean currents are weakest and correspond to a time when the mean wind opposes the alongshore flow. Again, intra-annual variability is much greater than interannual, with the fall season exhibiting the most interseasonal variability in the surface current patterns. The extreme fall seasons of 2009 and 2011 are related to extremes in the wind and river discharge events caused by different persistent synoptic meteorological conditions, resulting in more or less rapid fall transitions from stratified summer to well-mixed winter conditions.\\nC1 [Roarty, Hugh; Glenn, Scott; Brodie, Joseph; Nazzaro, Laura; Smith, Michael; Handel, Ethan; Kohut, Josh] Rutgers State Univ, Ctr Ocean Observing Leadership, New Brunswick, NJ 08854 USA.\\n   [Updyke, Teresa; Atkinson, Larry] Old Dominion Univ, Ctr Coastal Phys Oceanog, Norfolk, VA USA.\\n   [Boicourt, William] Univ Maryland, Ctr Environm Sci, Cambridge, MD USA.\\n   [Brown, Wendell] Univ Massachusetts Dartmouth, Sch Marine Sci & Technol, New Bedford, MA USA.\\n   [Seim, Harvey] Univ N Carolina, Dept Marine Sci, Chapel Hill, NC USA.\\n   [Muglia, Mike] East Carolina Univ, Dept Coastal Studies, Wanchese, NC USA.\\n   [Wang, Haixing; Gong, Donglai] Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Coll William & Mary, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA.\\nRP Roarty, H (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Ctr Ocean Observing Leadership, New Brunswick, NJ 08854 USA.\\nEM hroarty@marine.rutgers.edu\\nRI Brodie, Joseph F/H-8808-2019; Gong, Donglai/AAZ-7818-2021; Gong,\\n   Donglai/AAZ-7829-2021\\nOI Brodie, Joseph F/0000-0003-1041-5077; Gong, Donglai/0000-0002-1697-1739;\\n   Muglia, Michael/0000-0003-0914-9007; Updyke, Teresa/0000-0001-5738-5683;\\n   Roarty, Hugh/0000-0002-5048-7043\\nNR 67\\nTC 3\\nZ9 3\\nU1 1\\nU2 3\\nPU AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION\\nPI WASHINGTON\\nPA 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA\\nSN 2169-9275\\nEI 2169-9291\\nJ9 J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS\\nJI J.

Here we document past ecological changes in benthic foraminiferal assemblages indicative of deglacial changes in deep-sea oxygenation and the character of organic matter fluxes from sedimentary records retrieved at intermediate (692 m) and abyssal (3667m) depths in the Gulf of Alaska. Constrained multivariate ordination combining faunal and geochemical data over the past similar to 22,000 years distinguishes the impacts of pulsed productivity, which exports carbon to the abyss, from extreme dysoxia across the deglacial warming transition. At both depths, opportunistic species are more prevalent in interglacial conditions, reflecting higher pulsed organic matter export to the seafloor developed in response to warming and reduced sea-ice cover. Benthic foraminiferal species tolerant of low-oxygen conditions increased in abundance during the deglacial transition at both intermediate and abyssal depths. Authigenic trace metals reveal sulfidic sedimentary conditions indicative intermittent anoxia, but only at intermediate-depths. Benthic foraminiferal richness and evenness are also highest during this deglacial low-oxygen interval, likely due to high food availability. Last Glacial Maximum faunas were distinctly different at the two sites, consistent with a more stratified deep Pacific, but the faunas become more similar during Holocene time, suggesting destratification of the abyss during deglaciation. These ecosystem responses support that carbon fluxes increased during warm intervals in subpolar regions and underscores the importance of considering the effects of transient biological blooms on paleoceanographic interpretations and in model projections of future deep carbon export.\\nC1 [Belanger, Christina L.; Sharon; Payne, Calie R.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.\\n   [Du, Jianghui; Mix, Alan C.] Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.\\n   [Du, Jianghui] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Earth Sci, Inst Geochem & Petrol, Clausiusstr 25, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.\\nRP Belanger, CL (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.\\nEM Christina.Belanger@tamu.edu\\nRI Du, Jianghui/I-6570-2017; Mix, Alan/B-2366-2009\\nOI Du, Jianghui/0000-0002-3386-9314; Mix, Alan/0000-0001-7108-3534; ,\\n   SHARON/0000-0001-8543-856X; Belanger, Christina/0000-0002-1582-7647\\nFU NSF [1502746, 1801511, 1360894, 1502754]\\nFX This work was supported by NSF 1502746 and 1801511 to CLB and NSF\\n   1360894 and 1502754 to ACM.

However, the factors controlling the high SSC over there are not well understood. Therefore, we conducted 7-d hydrodynamic observations (water depth, wave height, and current velocity) and SSC measurements on the tidal flat off the Huanghe River Mouth. The data shows that in most of time, under the calm sea condition, the SSC ranges 0.1-3.5 g/L, and sediment discharge from the river is the main source. However, when hydrodynamics are enhanced in a tidal cycle and large-scale erosion occurs on the seafloor, resuspended sediment becomes the main source, and the SSC in the water column reaches 17.3 g/L. We find the suspended sediment flux is mainly controlled by the tidal current and Stokes drift, while the wave-induced shear stress could also affect the variation of suspended sediment flux. During the observation period, when sea under calm-rippled conditions, the current-induced resuspended sediment concentration (RSC) was greater than the wave-induced RSC. In contrast, in smooth-wavelet sea conditions, the wave-induced RSC was greater than the current-induced RSC, for instance, a single wave event was found to cause 11.8 cm seabed erosion within 6 h. This study reveals different controlling factors for the high SSC near a river-influenced tidal flat, and helps us get a better understanding of a delta\\'s depositional and erosional mechanisms.\\nC1 [Li, Bowen; Jia, Yonggang; Liu, Xiaolei] Ocean Univ China, Shandong Prov Key Lab Marine Environm & Geol Engn, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China.\\n   [Jia, Yonggang; Liu, Xiaolei] Pilot Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol Qingdao, Lab Marine Geol, Qingdao 266237, Peoples R China.\\n   [Li, Bowen; Liu, J.

In this paper we identify three feedbacks that help generate such oscillations within an Earth system model with a particularly regular oscillation. The first feedback involves increased (decreased) upward mixing of warm interior water to the surface, resulting in more (less) evaporation and loss of heat to the atmosphere which produces more (less) mixing. This positive feedback helps explain why temperature anomalies are not damped out by surface forcing. A second key mechanism involves convective (nonconvective) events in the Weddell Sea causing a relaxation (intensification) of westerly winds, which at some later time results in a pattern of currents that reduces (increases) the advection of freshwater out of the Weddell Sea. This allows for the surface to become lighter (denser) which in turn can dampen (trigger) convection-so that the overall feedback is a negative one with a delay-helping to produce a multidecadal oscillation time scale. The decrease (increase) in winds associated with convective (nonconvective) states also results in a decrease (increase) in the upward mixing of salt in the Eastern Weddell Sea, creating a negative (positive) salinity anomaly that propagates into the Western Weddell Sea and dampens (triggers) convection-again producing a negative feedback with a delay. A principal oscillatory pattern analysis yields a reasonable prediction for the period of oscillation. Strengths of the feedbacks are sensitive to parameterization of mesoscale eddies.\\nC1 [Gnanadesikan, Anand; Speller, Cassidy M.; Thomas, Jordan; Pradal, Marie-Aude] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.\\n   [Ringlein, Grace; San Soucie, John] Univ Penn, Dept Phys & Astron, Philadelphia, PA USA.\\n   [San Soucie, John] Univ Penn, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Philadelphia, PA USA.\\n   [San Soucie, John] MIT, MIT WHOI Joint Program Appl Ocean Phys & Engn, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.\\n   [Thomas, Jordan] Innovat Decis Inc, Vienna, VA USA.\\nRP Gnanadesikan, A (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.\\nEM gnanades@jhu.edu\\nRI Gnanadesikan, Anand/A-2397-2008\\nOI Gnanadesikan, Anand/0000-0001-5784-1116; RINGLEIN,\\n   GRACE/0000-0002-6583-7325\\nFU JHU Institute for Data-Intensive Science and Engineering; NSF\\n   [OCE-1756568]; Vagelos Fellowship from the University of Pennsylvania\\nFX Simulations were performed on the Homewood High Performance Computing\\n   Cluster supported by the JHU Institute for Data-Intensive Science and\\n   Engineering.

The leading-order balance is between the torques due to lateral friction, nonlinear effects, and bottom vortex stretching, although details vary regionally. Maps of the time-averaged depth-integrated vorticity budget terms and time series of the spatially averaged, depth-integrated vorticity budget terms reveal that the flow in the Amundsen, Bellingshausen, and Weddell Seas and, to a lesser extent, in the western portion of East Antarctica, is closer to an approximate topographic Sverdrup balance (TSB) compared to other segments of the ACM. Correlation and coherence analyses further support these findings, and also show that inclusion of the vorticity tendency term in the response (the planetary vorticity advection and the bottom vortex stretching term) increases the correlation with the forcing (the vertical net stress curl), and also increases the coherence between forcing and response at high frequencies across the ACM, except for the West Antarctic Peninsula. These findings suggest that the surface stress curl, imparted by the wind and the sea ice, has the potential to contribute to the meridional, approximately cross-slope, transport to a greater extent in the Amundsen, Bellingshausen, Weddell, and part of the East Antarctic continental margin than elsewhere in the ACM.\\nC1 [Paloczy, Andre; McClean, Julie L.; Gille, Sarah T.; Wang, He] Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.\\n   [Wang, He] Argonne Natl Lab, Lemont, IL USA.\\nRP Paloczy, A (通讯作者)，Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.\\nEM apaloczy@ucsd.edu\\nOI Gille, Sarah/0000-0001-9144-4368; Paloczy, Andre/0000-0001-8231-8298\\nFU U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-SC0014440, DE-SC0020073]; National\\n   Science Foundation (NSF) [ark:/85065/d7wd3xhc]; U.S. DOE Office of\\n   Science grant entitled \"Ultra-High Resolution Global Climate Simulation\"\\n   via a Los Alamos National Laboratory subcontract; NSF [PLR-1425989, OCE\\n   1658001]\\nFX A.P., J.L.M, and S.T.G. gratefully acknowledge support from the U.S.\\n   Department of Energy (DOE, Grants DE-SC0014440 and DE-SC0020073) and\\n   high-performance computing support from Yellowstone\\n   (ark:/85065/d7wd3xhc) provided by NCAR\\'s Climate Simulation Laboratory\\n   (CSL), sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and other\\n   agencies.

Ship-drift data have been used in the past hundred years under the assumption that they are reasonably accurate; the present study examines that assumption carefully, finding that the standard deviation of individual observations is typically similar to 20 cm s(-1). In a monthly mean composed of order 400 observations or more, as examined here, the standard error of the mean will be reduced accordingly. In the southern part of the western Gulf of Mexico, the observed upper-layer flow is clearly to the west and is consistent with our expectations. In the northern part, however, the apparent flow as reported by ship drift in deep water is not significantly different from zero. Thus, the puzzling result remains: three different datasets in the southern half of the basin clearly show flow to the west, with speeds of 10 cm s(-1) or more, yet there is no clear evidence of a near-surface return flow back to the east. The convergent wind stress forces downwelling of the upper layer; its return flow could be at some intermediate depth. The transport to the west from Loop Current rings is possibly returned in a deep boundary flow driven by the rectification of deep topographic Rossby waves.\\nC1 [Sturges, Wilton] Florida State Univ, Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.\\nRP Sturges, W (通讯作者)，Florida State Univ, Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.\\nEM wsturges@fsu.edu\\nNR 21\\nTC 1\\nZ9 1\\nU1 0\\nU2 0\\nPU AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC\\nPI BOSTON\\nPA 45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA\\nSN 0022-3670\\nEI 1520-0485\\nJ9 J PHYS OCEANOGR\\nJI J.

Yet the fundamental nature of turbidity currents is still debated; especially whether they are entirely dilute and turbulent, or a thin and dense basal layer drives the flow. This major knowledge gap is mainly due to a near-complete lack of direct measurements of sediment concentration within active submarine flows. Here we present the most detailed near-bed sediment concentrations measurements from a powerful turbidity current in Monterey Canyon, offshore California. We employ a novel approach using correlations between conductivity and sediment concentration, which unlike previous methods can measure very high concentrations and not sensitive to grain size. We find that sediment concentrations close to the canyon floor gradually increased after the arrival of the turbidity current, until reaching a maximum value of 12%, the highest concentration ever inferred from direct measurements in turbidity currents. We also show a two-layer flow head, with a fast (up to 4 m/s), thin and dense basal layer overlain by a thicker (similar to 50 m) dilute flow. At the interface of these two layers, there seems to be a sharp steep concentration gradient. Such quantitative measurements of sediment concentration can produce a key step forward in understanding the basic character and dynamics of these powerful submarine flows.\\nC1 [Wang, Zhiwen] Ocean Univ China, Coll Marine & Geosci, 238 Songling Rd, Qingdao 266100, Shandong, Peoples R China.\\n   [Xu, Jingping] Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ocean Sci & Engn, 1088 Xueyuan Rd, Shenzhen 518055, Guangdong, Peoples R China.\\n   [Xu, Jingping] Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Marine Geol, Qingdao 266061, Shandong, Peoples R China.\\n   [Talling, Peter J.; Cartigny, Matthieu J.

The exceptional fertility of this system is reportedly fueled not only by upwelled nutrients but also by nutrients regenerated on the broad and shallow continental shelf. We measured nutrient concentrations and the nitrogen (N) and oxygen (O) isotope ratios (delta N-15 and delta O-18) of nitrate along four zonal lines in the SBUS in late summer and early winter to evaluate the extent to which regenerated nutrients augment the upwelled nutrient reservoir originating offshore. During summer upwelling, a decrease in on-shelf nitrate delta O-18 revealed that 0-48% of the subsurface nutrients derived from in situ remineralization. The nitrate regenerated on-shelf in the more quiescent winter (0-63% of total nitrate) extended further offshore along the mid-shelf. A shoreward increase in subsurface nitrate delta N-15 and a greater N deficit in on-shelf bottom waters further indicated N loss to benthic (and at times, watercolumn) denitrification coincident with the on-shelf remineralization. Our data show that remineralized nutrients get trapped on the SBUS shelf in summer through early winter, enhancing the nutrient pool that can be upwelled to support surface production. We hypothesize that this process is aided by a number of equatorward-flowing hydrographic fronts that impede the lateral exchange of surface waters. The extent to which nutrients remain trapped on the shelf has implications for the occurrence of hypoxic events in the SBUS.\\nC1 [Flynn, R. F.; Burger, J. M.; Fawcett, S.

These differences result from drifters oversampling surface convergences and regions of intense vorticity. The first-, second-, and third-order structure functions are calculated using quasi-Lagrangian (drifter) and Eulerian data from approximately the same location and time. Differences between quasi-Lagrangian and Eulerian structure functions are attributed to two forms of bias. The first bias results from the mean divergence or vorticity of the background flow creating nonzero first-order structure functions. This background bias affects both quasi-Lagrangian and Eulerian data when insufficiently time-averaged. It severely biases the drifter third-order structure functions but is smaller in Eulerian structure functions at both second and third order. This bias can be corrected for using lower-order structure functions. The second form of bias results from drifters accumulating in regions with flow statistics that differ from undersampled regions. This accumulation bias is diagnosed by identifying the dependence of the Eulerian structure functions on divergence and vorticity as well as scale. Together, both biases suggest that caution is needed when interpreting second-order drifter statistics and that linking raw third-order drifter statistics to energy fluxes is often erroneous in ocean data: Even with background correction and sufficient time-averaging, drifters overestimate the Eulerian estimate of the third-order structure function by up to a factor of 5 when signs are consistent.\\nC1 [Pearson, Jenna; Fox-Kemper, Baylor] Brown Univ, Dept Earth Environm & Planetary Sci, Providence, RI 02912 USA.\\n   [Pearson, Brodie] Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.\\n   [Chang, Henry; Huntley, Helga S.; Kirwan, A.

To investigate sediment transport processes through the strait under the influence of storms (strong northerly winds) that frequently occur in winter, we deployed two sets of observing platforms equipped with Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP) and a suite of other sensors in the strait in January 2018. Aided by a system of high-resolution models, we reconstructed sediment dynamics in response to the strong northerly wind of a winter storm. Model results show that the instantaneous suspended sediment flux (SSF) is highly aligned with tidal currents, while the net sediment flux has a clear dependence on variations in exchange flow and sediment resuspension. Enhanced coastal currents, intensified wave motions, and higher suspended sediment concentrations indicate that the through-strait sediment flux during outflows is greater than during inflow conditions. Such SSF asymmetries are believed responsible for the net sediment export through the Bohai Strait in wintertime. Diagnostic analyses provided insights into the dynamic mechanisms of exchange flow variations influenced by both the strong northerly winds and the wind-triggered coastal trapped waves in the shallow, narrow strait via geostrophic effects. This study highlights the importance of storm-induced horizontal exchange processes in a coupled bay-shelf system.\\nC1 [Wang, Chenghao; Wu, Xiao; Wang, Houjie; Bi, Naishuang; Duan, Haiqin] Ocean Univ China, Coll Marine Geosci, Key Lab Submarine Geosci & Prospecting Tech, Qingdao, Peoples R China.\\n   [Liu, Zhiqiang; Xu, Jingping] Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ocean Sci & Engn, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.\\n   [Harris, Courtney K.] Virginia Inst Marine Sci, William & Mary, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA.\\n   [Bian, Changwei] Ocean Univ China, Phys Oceanog Lab CIMST, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China.\\n   [Wu, Xiao; Wang, Houjie; Bian, Changwei; Bi, Naishuang; Xu, Jingping] Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol QNLM, Lab Marine Geol, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China.\\nRP Xu, JP (通讯作者)，Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ocean Sci & Engn, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.; Xu, JP (通讯作者)，Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol QNLM, Lab Marine Geol, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China.\\nEM xujp@sustech.edu.cn\\nOI Harris, Courtney/0000-0001-5357-5906; Wang, Houjie/0000-0001-6409-0592;\\n   Wu, Xiao/0000-0001-9926-2526\\nFU National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41530966, 41476070,\\n   41525021]; Taishan Scholar Project of Shandong Province [TS20190913]\\nFX We sincerely express our thanks to the developers of the ROMS model and\\n   appreciate the guidance of Prof. Wensheng Jiang from the Ocean\\n   University of China.

Specifically, data used for a daily egg production method were combined with oceanographic data, prey availability, as well as acoustic surveys of the anchovy stock in the Strait of Sicily, in the Central Mediterranean Sea. Variables typically used for evaluating habitat dynamics (i.e. water temperature, chlorophyll-a, zooplankton concentration, kinetic energy, mixed layer depth and upwelling index) indicated strong upwelling events during the summer, when anchovy spawns. A linear \\'principal component\\' combination of environmental traits, associated with summer upwelling, was identified by step-wise regression as a driver for growth (length at the end of the first year; L1), reproductive investment (gonad-somatic index; GSI), as well as egg production (daily specific fecundity; DSF). These relationships are consistent with direct energy flow from the environment to both somatic growth and reproductive output, indicating an income breeding strategy by anchovy (i.e. surplus energy acquired during the summer breeding season is used directly for reproductive growth). Step-wise regression also identified three additional relationships: (1) a density-dependent mechanism reducing growth (L1) and fecundity (DSF) at higher fish densities; (2) higher fish condition (K-n) positively affecting growth (L1); (3) higher prey availability (mesozooplankton concentration) positively affecting GSI. This time series and approach are promising for exploring the abiotic and biotic mechanisms setting year class strength in advance of recruitment to the fishery.\\nC1 [Basilone, Gualtiero; Ferreri, Rosalia; Bonanno, Angelo; Pulizzi, Maurizio; Gargano, Antonella; Fontana, Ignazio; Giacalone, Giovanni; Mazzola, Salvatore; Genovese, Simona; Aronica, Salvatore] Consiglio Nazl Ric CNR, Ist Studio Impatti Antrop & Sostenibilita Ambient, Campobello Di Mazara, TP, Italy.\\n   [Barra, Marco; Rumolo, Paola] Consiglio Nazl Ric CNR, Ist Sci Marine ISMAR, Ss Di Napoli, Italy.\\n   [McBride, Richard] Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Northeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, 166 Water St, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\nRP Basilone, G (通讯作者)，Consiglio Nazl Ric CNR, Ist Studio Impatti Antrop & Sostenibilita Ambient, Campobello Di Mazara, TP, Italy.\\nEM gualtiero.basilone@cnr.it\\nRI Basilone, Gualtiero/D-2896-2017; Barra, Marco/AAY-1562-2020; Ferreri,\\n   Rosalia/AAQ-8033-2020; Rumolo, Paola/AAY-1671-2020; Genovese,\\n   Simona/ABH-1171-2020; McBride, Richard/C-2818-2012\\nOI Basilone, Gualtiero/0000-0002-5732-5055; Barra,\\n   Marco/0000-0002-8621-504X; Ferreri, Rosalia/0000-0001-7339-4942; Rumolo,\\n   Paola/0000-0002-1726-1077; McBride, Richard/0000-0003-1120-0414;\\n   Giacalone, Giovanni/0000-0001-8172-4710; Fontana,\\n   Ignazio/0000-0002-0527-9827\\nFU Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche through the Data Collection Framework\\n   (DCF) [199/2008, 665/2008, 949/2008]; European Union through the Data\\n   Collection Framework (DCF) [199/2008, 665/2008, 949/2008]\\nFX Surveys were cofinanced by the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche and\\n   the European Union through the Data Collection Framework (DCF - Reg.

Some species such as sperm whales are listed as vulnerable by the IUCN red list, whilst many beaked whale species are listed as data deficient, therefore, understanding their habitat is key for their successful conservation. A six-day survey was carried out in November 2017 to characterise the habitat of deep-diving odontocete species in this region by sampling multiple aspects of the ecosystem, from oceanographic features through to prey and predator distributions. Sampling of odontocete occurrence was carried out using both visual and acoustic surveys, supported by ten stations that sampled conductivity, temperature, fluorescence and zooplankton; at five of these stations, fish and cephalopod communities were also sampled during dusk and dawn to a maximum depth of 356 m. Results showed that temperature, salinity, and fluorescence were stable throughout the study area. Zooplankton were dominated by copepods, fish were dominated by myctophids, whilst cephalopods were dominated by Todarodes sagittatus and two Histioteuthis spp. Pilot whales, sperm whales and Sowerby\\'s beaked whales were detected both acoustically and visually, along with other delphinids in large numbers, providing evidence that the study covered rich foraging habitat for these species, especially along the 1000 m-2000 m deep continental slope.\\nC1 [Breen, Patricia] Natl Univ Ireland, Sch Geog & Archaeol, Newcastle Rd, Galway, Ireland.\\n   [Breen, Patricia; Pirotta, Enrico; Bennison, Ashley; Hearty, Aisling; Jessopp, Mark; Rogan, Emer] Univ Coll Cork, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Cork, Ireland.\\n   [Bennison, Ashley; Jessopp, Mark; Kavanagh, Ailbhe] Univ Coll Cork, MaREI Ctr, Environm Res Inst, Cork, Ireland.\\n   [Allcock, A.

The bioenergetics of a key forage fish in eastern Australia, yellowtail scad Trachurus novaezelandiae, was measured using static respirometry and bomb calorimetry to assess their trophic contribution as both predator and prey. The temperature-dependent standard metabolic rate (SMR) of yellowtail scad was 0.62 mgO(2) g (0.79) h(-1) and Q(10) of 1.98. The SMR was used with dietary information to calculate a minimum annual prey consumption of 17.8 g g(-0.79) y(-1) (at 20 degrees C), which is equivalent to an SMR-specific consumption:biomass ratio (Q:B-SMR) of 6.77 (100 g adult). This was incorporated into a standard energy balance model to estimate a total Q:B of at least 10.6 at 20 degrees C (or 7.2 at 14 degrees C), which is 2 to 3-fold larger than most values used to represent this species in ecosystem models. Implications of underestimating forage fish consumption could include errors in estimated prey biomass, ecotrophic efficiencies, or strength of top-down and bottom-up control. Yellowtail scad were a moderate-high value prey, with a mean energy density of 6 kJ g(-1) (+/- 0.97 s.d.). Energy density declined with body size and showed considerable inter-individual and spatial-temporal variation, indicating the potential to influence predator consumption rates at seasonal and fine spatial scales. This research highlights the value of measuring species-specific bioenergetics information for improving our understanding of trophic dynamics in marine ecosystems and models.\\nC1 [Dawson, Georgina; Suthers, Iain M.; Brodie, Stephanie; Smith, James A.] Univ New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.\\n   [Dawson, Georgina; Suthers, Iain M.] Sydney Inst Marine Sci, Chowder Bay Rd, Mosman, NSW 2088, Australia.\\n   [Brodie, Stephanie; Smith, James A.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Inst Marine Sci, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95062 USA.\\n   [Dawson, Georgina] New South Wales Dept Planning Ind & Environm, Parramatta, NSW 2150, Australia.\\nRP Smith, JA (通讯作者)，Univ New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.\\nEM james.smith@unsw.edu.au\\nRI Suthers, Iain M/C-4559-2008\\nOI Suthers, Iain M/0000-0002-9340-7461; Brodie,\\n   Stephanie/0000-0003-0869-9939\\nFU Australian Research Council Linkage Project [LP150100923]; School of\\n   Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences Student Research Grant\\nFX This study was funded by the Australian Research Council Linkage Project\\n   (LP150100923) and a School of Biological, Earth and Environmental\\n   Sciences Student Research Grant.

Here, we introduce a conceptual model for a two-basin marginal sea that better represents the Nordic seas geometry. In our conceptual model, the marginal sea is characterized by both a cyclonic boundary current and a front current as a result of different hydrographic properties east and west of the midocean ridge. The theory is compared to idealized model simulations and shows good agreement over a wide range of parameter settings, indicating that the physics in the two-basin marginal sea is well captured by the conceptual model. The balances between the atmospheric buoyancy forcing and the lateral eddy heat fluxes from the boundary current and the front current differ between the Lofoten and the Greenland Basins, since the Lofoten Basin is more strongly eddy dominated. Results show that this asymmetric sensitivity leads to opposing responses depending on the strength of the atmospheric buoyancy forcing. Additionally, the front current plays an essential role for the heat and volume budget of the two basins, by providing an additional pathway for heat toward the interior of both basins via lateral eddy heat fluxes. The variability of the temperature difference between east and west influences the strength of the different flow branches through the marginal sea and provides a dynamical explanation for the observed correlation between the front current and the slope current of the Norwegian Atlantic Current in the Nordic seas.\\nC1 [Ypma, S.

For >2 months in 2018, an array of eight floats obtained >20,000 temperature profiles from the surface to <200 m every <40 min before, during, and after Super Typhoons Mangkhut, Trami, Kong-Rey, and Yutu. Two floats were in/near Mangkhut\\'s eye, experienced gale force winds during Trami and Kong-Rey, drifted over 1,000 km westward with the North Equatorial Current, and tracked the advection of the weakly stratified, cold wake produced by the sequence of TCs. Sea surface temperature shows the westward advection of the cumulative cold wake. While causation cannot be established, since atmospheric measurements were not made, Yutu weakened as it passed over the cold wake. The stratification and the energy needed to mix the water column in the cold wake decreased with each TC. One float directly in the path of Yutu showed that mixing to 125-150 m was likely, corresponding to a cooling of 0.5-1 degrees C under the eye. Sea surface temperature in the cold wake cooled by 1 degrees C within a 150 km radius of Yutu\\'s eye, where the effect on air-sea heat fluxes is maximal. A cold wake can remain weakly stratified for many weeks during a sequence of TCs. These results also suggest that an advected cold wake from previous TCs may contribute many weeks later to the arrested development of a subsequent TC at a distant location.\\n   Plain Language Summary Cold wakes from previous tropical cyclones (TCs) are known to affect the development of subsequent TCs, but few subsurface data sets have sufficient persistence and spatial coverage to follow a cold wake as it is transported by currents. For >2 months in 2018, an array of eight profiling floats drifted >1,000 km westward and tracked the weakly stratified, cold wake produced by a sequence of three TCs. The subsequent Super Typhoon Yutu weakened into a typhoon, as it passed over the cold wake prior to landfall. Coincidence occurred, but causation cannot be established, since detailed atmospheric measurements were not made. The stratification and thus the energy needed to mix the water column in the cold wake decreased with each TC. One float directly in the path of Yutu showed that mixing to 125-150 m was likely, corresponding to a cooling of 0.5-1 degrees C under the eye, where the effect on air-sea heat fluxes that power TCs is maximal. These results show that a cold wake from previous TCs is transported by ocean currents to a distant location. The cold wake may possibly contribute many weeks later to the arrested development of a subsequent TC at a distant location.\\nC1 [Johnston, T. M.

Analyses of these observations have provided new understanding of large-scale mean circulation features and variability throughout the deep Gulf. Important features include cyclonic flow along the continental slope, deep cyclonic circulation in the western Gulf, a counterrotating pair of cells under the Loop Current region, and a cyclonic cell to the south of this pair. These dominant circulation features are represented in each of the ocean model simulations, although with some obvious differences. A striking difference between all the models and the observations is that the simulated deep eddy kinetic energy under the Loop Current region is generally less than one-half of that computed from observations. A multidecadal integration of one of these numerical simulations is used to evaluate the uncertainty of estimates of velocity statistics in the deep Gulf computed from limited-length (4 years) observational or model records. This analysis shows that the main deep circulation features identified from the observational studies appear to be robust and are not substantially impacted by variability on time scales longer than the observational records. Differences in strengths and structures of the circulation features are identified, however, and quantified through standard error analysis of the statistical estimates using the model solutions.\\nC1 [Morey, Steven L.] Florida A&M Univ, Tallahassee, FL 32307 USA.\\n   [Morey, Steven L.; Dukhovskoy, Dmitry; Chassignet, Eric] Florida State Univ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.\\n   [Gopalakrishnan, Ganesh; Cornuelle, Bruce] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.\\n   [Pallas Sanz, Enric; Correia De Souza, Joao Marcos Azevedo; Perez-Brunius, Paula; Candela, Julio] Ctr Invest Cient & Educac Super Ensenada, Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico.\\n   [Correia De Souza, Joao Marcos Azevedo] MetOcean Solut, New Plymouth, New Zealand.\\n   [Donohue, Kathleen] Univ Rhode Isl, Narragansett, RI USA.\\n   [Bower, Amy; Furey, Heather] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.\\n   [Hamilton, Peter] North Carolina State Univ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.\\nRP Morey, SL (通讯作者)，Florida A&M Univ, Tallahassee, FL 32307 USA.; Morey, SL (通讯作者)，Florida State Univ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.\\nEM steven.morey@famu.edu\\nRI Pérez-Brunius, Paula/AAB-7143-2022; Sanz, Enric Pallàs/I-1451-2015\\nOI Pérez-Brunius, Paula/0000-0003-1086-2870; Furey,\\n   Heather/0000-0003-2554-8681; Morey, Steven/0000-0002-6585-1688;\\n   Cornuelle, Bruce/0000-0003-2110-3319; Azevedo Correia de Souza, Joao\\n   Marcos/0000-0001-7745-157X\\nFU Gulf Research Program of the National Academy of Sciences [2000006422,\\n   2000009966]; CICESE-PetroleosMexicanos Grant [PEP-CICESE 428229851];\\n   Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), U.S. Dept. of the Interior\\nFX This work was supported by the Gulf Research Program of the National\\n   Academy of Sciences under Awards 2000006422 and 2000009966.

Our measurements resolve a similar to 10-km-wide bottom-intensified jet that carries 0.27 +/- 0.06 Sv (1 Sv equivalent to 10(6) m(3) s(-1)) of warm Atlantic water from Fram Strait toward the glaciers off northeast Greenland. Mean shoreward flows along the steep canyon walls reach 0.1 m s(-1) about 50 m above the bottom in 400-m-deep water. The same bottom-intensified vertical structure emerges as the first dominant empirical orthogonal function that explains about 70%-80% of the variance at individual mooring locations. We interpret the current variability as remotely forced wave motions that arrive at our sensor array with periodicities longer than 6 days. Coherent motions with a period near 20 days emerge in our array as a dispersive topographic Rossby wave that propagates its energy along the sloping canyon toward the coast with a group speed of about 63 km day(-1). Amplitudes of wave currents reach 0.1 m s(-1) in the winter of 2015/16. The wave is likely generated by Ekman pumping over the shelfbreak where sea ice is always mobile. More than 40% of the along-slope ocean current variance near the bottom of the canyon correlates with vertical Ekman pumping velocities 180 km away. In contrast, the impact of local winds on the observed current fluctuations is negligible. Dynamics appear linear and Rossby wave motions merely modulate the mean flow.\\nC1 [Munchow, Andreas] Univ Delaware, Newark, DE 19716 USA.\\n   [Schaffer, Janin; Kanzow, Torsten] Alfred Wegener Inst, Bremerhaven, Germany.\\nRP Munchow, A (通讯作者)，Univ Delaware, Newark, DE 19716 USA.\\nEM muenchow@udel.edu\\nRI Muenchow, Andreas/J-8257-2012\\nOI Muenchow, Andreas/0000-0001-8360-5686; Kanzow,\\n   Torsten/0000-0002-5786-3435\\nFU National Science Foundation [OPP-1362109, OPP-1604076]; Deutsche\\n   Forschungsgemeinschaft [KA-3204/5-1]\\nFX The National Science Foundation supported the initial fieldwork with\\n   OPP-1362109 and analyses with OPP-1604076 (AM) while the Deutsche\\n   Forschungsgemeinschaft funded JS and TK with KA-3204/5-1 as part of the\\n   Special Priority Program 1889 \"Regional Sea Level Change and Society.\"\\n   Both the University of Delaware and the Alfred Wegener Institute\\n   provided substantial additional support with capital equipment and\\n   salaries.

The impact of melt ponds on energy absorption is controlled primarily through their influence on ice albedo, which is, in turn, governed in large part by the ponds\\' spatial coverage. This work seeks to observe the spatial coverage of melt ponds across the Arctic basin with sufficient accuracy to investigate pond-albedo feedback and presents an improved technique to achieve this goal. We approach the problem by using the Open Source Sea Ice Processing algorithm to classify surface features in submeter resolution optical satellite imagery over select sites where such imagery is available. These data establish \"true\" estimates of pond coverage and the ponds\\' spectral reflectance. This information is then used to inform, improve, and test spectral unmixing and machine learning techniques that seek to determine melt pond coverage from more widely available, but lower resolution, optical satellite imagery (e.g., Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer). The new machine learning approach improves accuracy from prior work and can contribute to improved efforts to validate melt pond models or understand trends in pond coverage. Nevertheless, we encounter and carefully document significant challenges to retrieving melt pond fractions from low-resolution optical imagery. These limit accuracy to levels below that necessary for resolving climatologically important trends. We conclude that greatly expanding the collection of highresolution satellite imagery over sea ice is necessary to monitor melt pond coverage with the accuracy needed by the scientific community.\\n   Plain Language Summary As temperatures in the Arctic rise during summer months, meltwater pools on the surface of sea ice. These ponds are darker than snow/ice and cause more sunlight to be absorbed. This creates a feedback cycle that accelerates ice melt. A primary factor in this cycle is the percentage of the ice surface that is covered by ponds. It is therefore important to observe the spatial coverage of ponds across the Arctic to better understand their impact sea ice loss. Due to the remoteness of the Arctic Ocean, it is necessary to utilize satellite imagery to investigate the properties of sea ice. In satellite imagery there is a trade-off between resolution and spatial coverage: Images can be either \"sharp,\" seeing many details of the surface but covering a small region, or \"blurry\" covering a large region but where each pixel contains many ponds. This work seeks to improve techniques (called spectral unmixing) for determining the fraction of each low-resolution pixel that is a pond. We investigate the theoretical limits of spectral unmixing and conclude that it has several limitations that negatively impact its usefulness. Finally, we trial a new machine learning approach to the same problem that shows promising results.\\nC1 [Wright, Nicholas C.; Polashenski, Chris M.] Dartmouth Coll, Thayer Sch Engn, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.\\n   [Polashenski, Chris M.] US Army Cold Reg Res & Engn Labs, Hanover, NH USA.\\nRP Wright, NC (通讯作者)，Dartmouth Coll, Thayer Sch Engn, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.\\nEM ncwright.th@dartmouth.edu\\nFU Office of Naval Research [N0001413MP20144]; National Science Foundation,\\n   Office of Polar Programs [1417436]\\nFX This work was funded by the Office of Naval Research (grant\\n   N0001413MP20144) and the National Science Foundation, Office of Polar\\n   Programs (grant 1417436).

Monitored since 1990, it depends on water temperature and factors controlling the volume transport, assumed to be local winds in the strait and an oceanic pressure difference between the Pacific and Arctic oceans (the \"pressure head\"). Recent work suggests that variability in the pressure head, especially during summer, relates to the strength of the zonal wind in the East Siberian Sea that raises or drops sea surface height in this area via Ekman transport. We confirm that westward winds in the East Siberian Sea relate to a broader central Arctic pattern of high sea level pressure and note that anticyclonic winds over the central Arctic Ocean also favor low September sea ice extent for the Arctic as a whole by promoting ice convergence and positive temperature anomalies. Month-to-month persistence in the volume transport and atmospheric circulation patterns is low, but the period 1980-2017 had a significant summertime (June-August) trend toward higher sea level pressure over the central Arctic Ocean, favoring increased transports. Some recent large heat transports are associated with high water temperatures, consistent with persistence of open water in the Chukchi Sea into winter and early ice retreat in spring. The highest heat transport recorded, October 2016, resulted from high water temperatures and ideal wind conditions yielding a record-high volume transport. November and December 2005, the only months with southward volume (and thus heat) transports, were associated with southward winds in the strait.\\nC1 [Serreze, Mark C.; Barrett, Andrew P.] Univ Colorado Boulder, Natl Snow & Ice Data Ctr, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.\\n   [Crawford, Alex D.] Coll Wooster, Dept Earth Sci, Wooster, OH 44691 USA.\\n   [Woodgate, Rebecca A.] Univ Washington, Appl Phys Lab, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.\\nRP Serreze, MC (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado Boulder, Natl Snow & Ice Data Ctr, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.\\nEM serreze@nsidc.org\\nRI Crawford, Alex D/N-5889-2017\\nOI Crawford, Alex D/0000-0003-1561-290X; Serreze, Mark/0000-0001-7670-0140\\nFU NSF [PLR 1603914, OPP 1748953]; NSF Arctic Observing Network [PLR\\n   1304052, PLR 1758565]\\nFX This study was supported by NSF Grants PLR 1603914 and OPP 1748953 (both\\n   Serreze) and NSF Arctic Observing Network Grants PLR 1304052 and PLR\\n   1758565 (both Woodgate).

However, the impacts of subseasonal wind variability on the ocean are not fully understood. Here, we quantify the sensitivity of the ocean surface stress (), buoyancy flux (B), and mixed layer depth (MLD) to subseasonal wind variability in both a one-dimensional (1-D) vertical column model and a three-dimensional (3-D) global mesoscale-resolving ocean/sea ice model. The winds are smoothed by time filtering the pseudo-stresses, so the mean stress is approximately unchanged, and some important surface flux feedbacks are retained. The 1-D results quantify the sensitivities to wind variability at different time scales from 120 days to 1 day at a few sites. The 3-D results quantify the sensitivities to wind variability shorter than 60 days at all locations, and comparisons between 1-D and 3-D results highlight the importance of 3-D ocean dynamics. Globally, subseasonal winds explain virtually all of subseasonal variance, about half of subseasonal B variance but only a quarter of subseasonal MLD variance. Subseasonal winds also explain about a fifth of the annual mean MLD and a similar and spatially correlated fraction of the mean friction velocity, u*=|tau|/rho sw where rho(sw) is the density of seawater. Hence, the subseasonal MLD variance is relatively insensitive to subseasonal winds despite their strong impact on local B and variability, but the mean MLD is relatively sensitive to subseasonal winds to the extent that they modify the mean u(*), and both of these sensitivities are modified by 3-D ocean dynamics.\\nC1 [Whitt, D.

This study investigated how Atlantic water intrusion and tidewater glacial melting impacted water mass formation and phytoplankton distribution in Kongsfjorden, Svalbard. Field data were collected over a 2-week period during the height of the melt season in August 2014 and were contextualized within an 18-year regional MODIS satellite record. Since 1998, intruding waters have warmed by 4-5.5 degrees C, which has prevented sea ice formation and changed the characteristics of fjord bottom waters. Modeled light fields suggest that suspended sediment in this glacial meltwater has reduced the euphotic zone close to the ice face, contributing to lower phytoplankton concentrations in both persistent and intermittently sediment-laden meltwater plumes. However, measurements collected close to terrestrially terminating glaciers indicate that turbidity is significantly lower in the meltwater plumes, resulting in deep euphotic zones and high phytoplankton concentrations. The results of this study support a three-part conceptual model of the effects of warm-water intrusion on water mass formation and primary production within 10 km of tidewater glaciers. Initially, warm water intrusion reduces sea ice coverage, which increases the euphotic depth and increases phytoplankton biomass. Warm water intrusions may also result in increased melting of tidewater glaciers, enhanced sediment release, reduction in euphotic depth and reduction in phytoplankton biomass. Ultimately, as tidewater glaciers retreat and become terrestrially terminating, the sediment load decreases, the euphotic zone again increases, and phytoplankton biomass increases.\\nC1 [Payne, Courtney M.; Roesler, Collin S.] Bowdoin Coll, Dept Earth & Oceanog Sci, Brunswick, ME 04011 USA.\\n   [Payne, Courtney M.] Stanford Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.\\nRP Roesler, CS (通讯作者)，Bowdoin Coll, Dept Earth & Oceanog Sci, Brunswick, ME 04011 USA.\\nEM cmpayne@stanford.edu; croesler@bowdoin.edu\\nFU NSF\\'s Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program [0649006];\\n   Bowdoin College\\'s Grua/O\\'Connell fellowship; NASA Ocean Biology and\\n   Biogeochemistry Program\\nFX This research was conducted with support from NSF\\'s Research Experience\\n   for Undergraduates (REU) program (#0649006), Bowdoin College\\'s\\n   Grua/O\\'Connell fellowship and the NASA Ocean Biology and Biogeochemistry\\n   Program.

Independent effective eddy diffusivity profiles were computed under the assumption that the turbulent exchange of heat, salt and buoyancy through each isobath below 400 m will balance the rate of change of the corresponding variable\\'s content of the water volume within the basin below that depth. The initially estimated thermal, saline and density diffusivity profiles were significantly different from each other. Assuming turbulence was the dominant mixing process between the intermediate and deep water masses led to identification of conductivity sensor drift rate of 4.6 x 10(-6) Sm-1 day(-1) . After correcting the sensor\\'s drift, bulk eddy diffusivities K-p, K-s and K-T were found to span (2-30) x 10(-3) m(2) s(-1) , in close agreement below 400 m depth. These estimates are at least one order of magnitude higher than eddy diffusivities based on a finescale internal-wave strain parameterization. Enhanced boundary mixing and double diffusion are examined as candidates to explain the high effective diffusivity values. A hypsometric correction appears to provide sufficient diapycnal transport along the boundaries to reproduce bulk buoyancy transports.\\nC1 [Zervakis, V; Krauzig, N.; Tragou, E.] Univ Aegean, Sch Environm, Dept Marine Sci, Mitilini, Greece.\\n   [Kunze, E.] NorthWest Res Assoc, Redmond, WA USA.\\n   [Krauzig, N.] Parthenope Univ Naples, Naples, Italy.\\nRP Zervakis, V (通讯作者)，Univ Aegean, Sch Environm, Dept Marine Sci, Mitilini, Greece.\\nEM zervakis@marine.aegean.gr\\nRI Krauzig, Naomi/AAU-4616-2021; Zervakis, Vassilis/AAN-2144-2021; Tragou,\\n   Elina/AAU-3658-2021\\nOI Krauzig, Naomi/0000-0002-9846-4318; Tragou, Elina/0000-0003-0101-6410;\\n   Zervakis, Vassilis/0000-0001-7219-341X\\nFU Hellenic Republic [MIS: 380213]; European Social Fund via the General\\n   Secretariat of Research and Technology [MIS: 380213]\\nFX This study was part of the GreekArgo project (project code nr/MIS:\\n   380213), implemented through the Operational Program \"Attica\" of the\\n   National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF), cofunded by the Hellenic\\n   Republic and the European Social Fund via the General Secretariat of\\n   Research and Technology.

The eddy was situated 50-km seaward of the Chukchi Sea shelfbreak over the 1,000 m isobath, embedded in the offshore side of the Chukchi slope current. The eddy core, centered near 150-m depth, consisted of newly ventilated Pacific winter water which was high in nitrate and dissolved oxygen. Its fluorescence signal was due to phaeopigments rather than chlorophyll, indicating that photosynthesis was no longer active, consistent with an eddy age on the order of months. Subtracting out the slope current signal demonstrated that the eddy velocity field was symmetrical with a peak azimuthal speed of order 10 cm s(-1). Its Rossby number was similar to 0.4, consistent with the fact that the measured cyclogeostrophic velocity was dominated by the geostrophic component. Different scenarios are discussed regarding how the eddy became embedded in the slope current, and what the associated ramifications are with respect to eddy spin-down and ventilation of the Canada Basin halocline.\\n   Plain Language Summary A critical feature of the interior Arctic Ocean is the sharp vertical change in salinity between roughly 100-m to 200-m depth, known as the cold halocline. This shields the warm Atlantic-origin water below from mixing upward to the surface and melting the pack ice. The cold halocline is believed to be partially maintained by eddies of cold water emanating from the Chukchi Sea continental shelf. This paper presents measurements from a rapid, high-resolution shipboard survey of a cold-core Arctic eddy offshore of the shelf edge, providing a unique three-dimensional view of the feature. The eddy\\'s core contained water near the freezing point with a high level of nitrate, but the biological activity had largely ceased because the eddy had descended below the part of the water column exposed to sunlight. The eddy was imbedded in the offshore edge of the westward-flowing Chukchi slope current. Different scenarios are discussed regarding how the eddy became embedded in the slope current, and what the associated ramifications are with respect to disintegration of the eddy and the manner in which the cold water feeds the halocline.\\nC1 [Scott, Ryan M.; Brearley, J.

Where these currents hit the coast, the no-normal-flow boundary condition leads to vertical velocities that pump both the base of the mixed layer and the free surface, producing offshore-propagating near-inertial internal and surface waves, respectively. The internal waves directly transport wind work downward into the ocean\\'s stratified interior, where it may provide mechanical mixing. The surface waves propagate offshore where they can scatter over rough topography in a process analogous to internal-tide generation. Here, we estimate mixed layer currents from observed winds using a damped slab model. Then, we estimate the pressure, velocity, and energy flux associated with coastally generated near-inertial waves at a vertical coastline. These results are extended to coasts with arbitrary across-shore topography and examined using numerical simulations. At the New Jersey shelfbreak, comparisons between the slab model, numerical simulations, and moored observations are ambiguous. Extrapolation of the theoretical results suggests that O(10%) of global wind work (i.e., 0.03 of 0.31 TW) is transferred to coastally generated barotropic near-inertial waves.\\nC1 [Kelly, Samuel M.] Univ Minnesota, Large Lakes Observ, Duluth, MN 55812 USA.\\n   [Kelly, Samuel M.] Univ Minnesota, Phys & Astron Dept, Duluth, MN 55812 USA.\\nRP Kelly, SM (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Large Lakes Observ, Duluth, MN 55812 USA.; Kelly, SM (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Phys & Astron Dept, Duluth, MN 55812 USA.\\nEM smkelly@d.umn.edu\\nFU National Science Foundation [OCE-1635560]; Office of Naval Research\\n   [N00014-181-2800]\\nFX This work was supported by the National Science Foundation Grant\\n   OCE-1635560 and Office of Naval Research Grant N00014-181-2800\\n   (NISKINE).

The European Space Agency\\'s Envisat (2002-2010) and CryoSat-2 (2010-present) satellite radar altimeter missions provide a continuous 17-year dataset with the potential to estimate sea ice thickness. However, the satellite footprints are not equal in area and so different distributions of floes and leads are sampled by each mission. Here, we compare lead and floe sampling from Envisat and CryoSat-2 to investigate the impact of geometric sampling differences on Arctic sea ice thickness estimates. We find that Envisat preferentially samples wider, thicker sea ice floes, and that floes in less consolidated ice regions are effectively thickened by off-nadir ranging to leads. Consequently, Envisat sea ice thicknesses that are an average of 80 cm higher than CryoSat-2 over first-year ice and 23 cm higher over multiyear ice. By considering the along-track distances between lead and floe measurements, we are able to develop a sea ice thickness correction that is based on Envisat\\'s inability to resolve discrete surfaces relative to CryoSat-2. This is a novel, physically based approach to addressing the bias between the satellites and reduces the average thickness difference to negligible values over first-year and multiyear ice. Finally, we evaluate our new bias-corrected Envisat sea ice thickness product using independent airborne, moored-buoy and submarine data. The European Space Agency\\'s Envisat and CryoSat-2 satellites have the potential to produce a continuous record of Arctic sea ice thickness since 2002, but this is complicated by the fact that the satellites do not sample the sea ice surface in the same way. We find that Envisat is only able to sample larger, thicker sea ice relative to CryoSat-2, because of its poorer resolution. In this paper we account for these differences in sampling to combine Arctic sea ice thickness estimates from two the satellite missions. Applying a sea ice thickness bias correction to Envisat data reduces the ice thickness difference between Envisat and CryoSat-2 from an average of 53.0 to 0.5 cm\\nC1 [Tilling, R.] NASA, Cryospher Sci Lab, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.\\n   [Tilling, R.] Univ Maryland, Earth Syst Sci Interdisciplinary Ctr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.\\n   [Ridout, A.] UCL, Ctr Polar Observat & Modelling, London, England.\\n   [Shepherd, A.] Univ Leeds, Ctr Polar Observat & Modelling, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.\\nRP Tilling, R (通讯作者)，NASA, Cryospher Sci Lab, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.; Tilling, R (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Earth Syst Sci Interdisciplinary Ctr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.\\nEM rachel.l.tilling@nasa.gov\\nOI Ridout, Andrew/0000-0003-3669-1109\\nFU UK Natural Environment Research Council Centre for Polar Observation and\\n   Modelling; European Space Agency; NERC [cpom30001] Funding Source: UKRI\\nFX This work was funded by the UK Natural Environment Research Council\\n   Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling and the European Space\\n   Agency.

In both the tropical and midlatitude regions, the barotropic energy conversion from background flow to eddies is positive throughout the wavenumber space and generally peaks at the scale (L-e) where EKE reaches its maximum. The baroclinic energy conversion is more pronounced at midlatitudes. It exhibits a dipolar structure with positive and negative values at scales smaller and larger than L-e, respectively. Surface wind power on geostrophic flow results in a significant EKE loss around L-e but deposits energy at larger scales. The interior viscous dissipation and bottom drag inferred from the pressure flux convergence act as EKE sink terms. The latter is most efficient at L-e while the former is more dominant at smaller scales. There is an evident mismatch between EKE generation and dissipation in the spectral space especially at the midlatitudes. This is reconciled by a dominant forward energy cascade on the equator and a dominant inverse energy cascade at the midlatitudes.\\nC1 [Wang, Shengpeng; Jing, Zhao; Zhang, Qiuying; Chang, Ping; Chen, Zhaohui; Wu, Lixin] Ocean Univ China, Inst Adv Ocean Studies, Key Lab Phys Oceanog, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China.\\n   [Wang, Shengpeng; Jing, Zhao; Zhang, Qiuying; Chang, Ping; Chen, Zhaohui; Wu, Lixin] Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China.\\n   [Zhang, Qiuying; Chang, Ping] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Oceanog, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.\\n   [Chang, Ping] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, College Stn, TX USA.\\n   [Liu, Hailong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing, Peoples R China.\\nRP Jing, Z (通讯作者)，Ocean Univ China, Inst Adv Ocean Studies, Key Lab Phys Oceanog, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China.; Jing, Z (通讯作者)，Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China.\\nEM jingzhao198763@sina.com\\nFU Marine S&T Fund of Shandong Province for Pilot National Laboratory for\\n   Marine Science and Technology (Qingdao) [2018SDKJ0102-7-7]; NSFC\\n   [41490643, 41490640]; National Key Research and Development Program of\\n   China [2016YFC1402606]; Natural Science Foundation of China [41622602];\\n   AoShan Talents Program [2017ASTCP-ES05]; Fundamental Research Funds for\\n   the Central Universities [201762013]; National Science Foundation;\\n   Office of Science (BER) of the U.S. Department of Energy\\nFX This research is financially supported by the Marine S&T Fund of\\n   Shandong Province for Pilot National Laboratory for Marine Science and\\n   Technology (Qingdao) (2018SDKJ0102-7-7), NSFC Projects (41490643,\\n   41490640), National Key Research and Development Program of China\\n   (2016YFC1402606), Natural Science Foundation of China (41622602), AoShan\\n   Talents Program (2017ASTCP-ES05), and Fundamental Research Funds for the\\n   Central Universities (201762013).

Parametric models employ wave (e.g., H-s and L-p) and beach (i.e., beta) parameters to estimate extreme runup (e.g., R-2%). Thus, recent studies have been devoted to improving such parameterizations by including additional information regarding wave forcing or beach morphology features. However, the effects of intra-wave dynamics, related to the random nature of the wave transformation process, on runup statistics have not been incorporated. This work employs a phase- and depth- resolving model, based on the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations, to investigate different sources of variability associated with runup on planar beaches. The numerical model is validated with laboratory runup data. Subsequently, the role of both aleatory uncertainty and other known sources of runup variability (i.e., frequency spreading and bed roughness) is investigated. Model results show that aleatory uncertainty can be more important than the contributions from other sources of variability such as the bed roughness and frequency spreading. Ensemble results are employed to develop a new parametric model which uses the Hunt (J Waterw Port Coastal Ocean Eng 85:123-152, 1959) scaling parameter beta (HsLp)(1/2).\\nC1 [Torres-Freyermuth, Alec] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ingn, Puerto de Abrigo S-N, Sisal 97356, YU, Mexico.\\n   [Carlos Pintado-Patino, Jose] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Escuela Nacl Estudios Super, Unidad Merida, Carretera Merida Tetiz,Km 4, Ucu 97357, YU, Mexico.\\n   [Pedrozo-Acuna, Adrian] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ingn, Circuito Escolar S-N,Ciudad Univ, Delegacion Coyoacan 04510, Cdmx, Mexico.\\n   [Puleo, Jack A.] Univ Delaware, Ctr Appl Coastal Res, Newark, DE 19716 USA.\\n   [Baldock, Tom E.] Univ Queensland, Sch Civil Engn, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.\\nRP Torres-Freyermuth, A (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ingn, Puerto de Abrigo S-N, Sisal 97356, YU, Mexico.\\nEM ATorresF@iingen.unam.mx; jose.pintado@enesmerida.unam.mx;\\n   APedrozoA@iingen.unam.mx; jpuleo@udel.edu; t.baldock@uq.edu.au\\nRI Pintado-Patiño, Jose Carlos/ABD-6203-2020; Baldock, Tom E/B-1474-2008;\\n   Torres-Freyermuth, Alec/M-2640-2019; Baldock, Tom/X-7941-2019\\nOI Pintado-Patiño, Jose Carlos/0000-0002-6177-5868; Baldock, Tom\\n   E/0000-0001-7040-9643; Torres-Freyermuth, Alec/0000-0003-0203-8734;\\n   Baldock, Tom/0000-0001-7040-9643\\nFU ONR Global; CONACYT [CB-2016-284430, LN 271544]; UNAM through PAPIIT\\n   DGAPA [PAPIIT IN101218]; University of Delaware; Mexican National\\n   Council of Science and Technology (CoNACyT) [490080]; Instituto de\\n   Ingenieria\\nFX We acknowledge ONR Global and CONACYT (CB-2016-284430 and LN 271544) for\\n   financial support.

Here, we quantify variability in the SLD\\'s sea surface slope, area, amplitude, and position using a 22-year record of absolute dynamic topography. We observe a seasonal cycle in the evolution of the SLD and its relationship to wind stress curl. The SLD typically forms in early June in a region of positive wind stress curl associated with the wind jet off Sri Lanka. For the first two months after formation, the magnitude of the SLD\\'s sea surface slope strongly correlates with the strength of the wind stress curl. Later in the southwest monsoon, the SLD\\'s position shifts northward moving out of the region of strong wind stress curl, before dissipating in typically September. The amplitude and area of the SLD vary together, and both are linked to the strength of the SMC on weekly timescales. Decadal variability in both the SLD and wind stress curl is reflected in the Dipole Mode Index, which reflects an integrated measure of regional forcing. These results suggest alignment between the SMC and the region of wind stress curl may play a pivotal role in controlling the strength of the SLD on seasonal and interannual timescales.\\nC1 [Cullen, K.

The physical observations like sea surface temperature usually have smaller errors than ocean colour, but it is unclear how far they can also constrain the biogeochemical model variables. Here, the effect of assimilating satellite sea surface temperature into the coastal ocean-biogeochemical model HBM-ERGOM with nested model grids in the North and Baltic Seas is investigated. A weakly and strongly coupled assimilation is performed with an ensemble Kalman filter. For the weakly coupled assimilation, the assimilation only directly influences the physical variables, while the biogeochemical variables react only dynamically during the 12-hour forecast phases in between the assimilation times. For the strongly coupled assimilation, both the physical and biogeochemical variables are directly updated by the assimilation. The strongly coupled assimilation is assessed in two variants using the actual concentrations and the common approach to use the logarithm of the concentrations of the biogeochemical fields. In this coastal domain, both the weakly and strongly coupled assimilation are stable, but only if the actual concentrations are used for the strongly coupled case. Compared to the weakly coupled assimilation, the strongly coupled assimilation leads to stronger changes of the biogeochemical model fields. Validating the resulting field estimates with independent in situ data shows only a clear improvement for the temperature and for oxygen concentrations, while no clear improvement of other biogeochemical fields was found. The oxygen concentrations were more strongly improved with strongly coupled than weakly coupled assimilation. The experiments further indicate that for the strongly coupled assimilation of physical observations the biogeochemical fields should be used with their actual concentrations rather than the logarithmic concentrations.\\nC1 [Goodliff, Michael; Nerger, Lars] Helmholtz Zentrum Polar & Meeresforsch, Alfred Wegener Inst, Bremerhaven, Germany.\\n   [Bruening, Thorger; Schwichtenberg, Fabian; Li, Xin; Lindenthal, Anja; Lorkowski, Ina] Bundesamt Seeschifffahrt & Hydrog, Hamburg, Germany.\\n   [Goodliff, Michael] Colorado State Univ, Cooperat Inst Res Atmosphere, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.\\nRP Nerger, L (通讯作者)，Helmholtz Zentrum Polar & Meeresforsch, Alfred Wegener Inst, Bremerhaven, Germany.\\nEM lars.nerger@awi.de\\nRI Nerger, Lars/G-4845-2013; Nerger, Lars/AAD-9248-2020\\nOI Nerger, Lars/0000-0002-1908-1010; Nerger, Lars/0000-0002-1908-1010\\nFU GODAE OceanView Coastal Oceans and Shelf Seas Task Team (COSS-TT) - Part\\n   II\\nFX This article is part of the Topical Collection on Coastal Ocean\\n   Forecasting Science supported by the GODAE OceanView Coastal Oceans and\\n   Shelf Seas Task Team (COSS-TT) - Part II\\nNR 55\\nTC 11\\nZ9 11\\nU1 2\\nU2 10\\nPU SPRINGER HEIDELBERG\\nPI HEIDELBERG\\nPA TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY\\nSN 1616-7341\\nEI 1616-7228\\nJ9 OCEAN DYNAM\\nJI Ocean Dyn.\\nPD OCT\\nPY 2019\\nVL 69\\nIS 10\\nBP 1217\\nEP 1237\\nDI 10.1007/s10236-019-01299-7\\nPG 21\\nWC Oceanography\\nWE Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)\\nSC Oceanography\\nGA JD5HO\\nUT WOS:000490014300007\\nOA Green Submitted\\nDA 2022-06-16\\nER\\n\\nPT J\\nAU Schlosser, TL\\n   Jones, NL\\n   Bluteau, CE\\n   Alford, MH\\n   Ivey, GN\\n   Lucas, AJ\\nAF Schlosser, Tamara L.\\n   Jones, Nicole L.\\n   Bluteau, Cynthia E.\\n   Alford, Matthew H.\\n   Ivey, Gregory N.\\n   Lucas, Andrew J.\\nTI Generation and Propagation of Near-Inertial Waves in a Baroclinic\\n   Current on the Tasmanian Shelf\\nSO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY\\nLA English\\nDT Article\\nDE Ocean; Australia; Dynamics; Internal waves; In situ oceanic observations\\nID COASTAL-TRAPPED WAVES; NEW-ENGLAND SHELF; INTERNAL WAVES; MIXED-LAYER;\\n   WIND STRESS; ENERGY; MOTIONS; SURFACE; VARIABILITY; DYNAMICS\\nAB Near-inertial waves (NIWs) are often an energetic component of the internal wave field on windy continental shelves. The effect of baroclinic geostrophic currents, which introduce both relative vorticity and baroclinicity, on NIWs is not well understood. Relative vorticity affects the resonant frequency f(eff), while both relative vorticity and baroclinicity modify the minimum wave frequency of freely propagating waves omega(min). On a windy and narrow shelf, we observed wind-forced oscillations that generated NIWs where f(eff) was less than the Coriolis frequency f. If everywhere f(eff) > f then NIWs were generated where omega(min) < f and f(eff) was smallest. The background current not only affected the location of generation, but also the NIWs\\' propagation direction. The estimated NIW energy fluxes show that NIWs propagated predominantly toward the equator because omega(min) > f on the continental slope for the entire sample period. In addition to being laterally trapped on the shelf, we observed vertically trapped and intensified NIWs that had a frequency omega within the anomalously low-frequency band (i.e., omega(min) < omega < f(eff)), which only exists if the baroclinicity is nonzero. We observed two periods when omega(min) < f on the shelf, but the relative vorticity was positive (i.e., f(eff) > f) for one of these periods. The process of NIW propagation remained consistent with the local omega(min), and not f(eff), emphasizing the importance of baroclinicity on the NIW dynamics. We conclude that windy shelves with baroclinic background currents are likely to have energetic NIWs, but the current and seabed will adjust the spatial distribution and energetics of these NIWs.\\nC1 [Schlosser, Tamara L.; Jones, Nicole L.; Ivey, Gregory N.] Univ Western Australia, Oceans Grad Sch, Crawley, WA, Australia.\\n   [Schlosser, Tamara L.; Jones, Nicole L.; Ivey, Gregory N.] Univ Western Australia, Ocean Inst, Crawley, WA, Australia.\\n   [Bluteau, Cynthia E.] Univ Quebec Rimouski, Inst Sci Mer, Rimouski, PQ, Canada.\\n   [Alford, Matthew H.; Lucas, Andrew J.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.\\nRP Schlosser, TL (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Oceans Grad Sch, Crawley, WA, Australia.; Schlosser, TL (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Ocean Inst, Crawley, WA, Australia.\\nEM tamaralschlosser@gmail.com\\nRI Ivey, Gregory N/K-5299-2012; Schlosser, Tamara/AAW-8404-2020; Bluteau,\\n   Cynthia/F-3758-2011; Jones, Nicole L/A-3549-2009\\nOI Ivey, Gregory N/0000-0003-2469-2470; Schlosser,\\n   Tamara/0000-0001-7779-7255; Bluteau, Cynthia/0000-0002-4430-0668; Jones,\\n   Nicole L/0000-0003-2550-4590; Lucas, Andrew/0000-0001-7722-7252\\nFU Australian Research Council Discovery Project [DP 140101322]; UWA\\n   Research Collaboration Award; Australian Government Research Training\\n   Program (RTP) Scholarship; National Science Foundation [OCE-1129763,\\n   T4/M32]\\nFX An Australian Research Council Discovery Project (DP 140101322), and a\\n   UWA Research Collaboration Award funded this work.

Air-sea CO2 fluxes indicate this region was a weak net source of CO2 to the atmosphere (0.7 +/- 0.9 mmol C m(-2) day(-1)) during the period of observation, with the largest degree of surface water supersaturation (Delta fCO(2) = +45 mu atm) in ice-covered waters near the Totten Ice Shelf (TIS) as compared to the ice-free surface waters in the Dalton Polynya. The seasonal depletion of mixed-layer TCO2 (6 to 51 mu mol/kg) in ice-free regions was primarily driven by sea ice melt and biological CO2 uptake. Estimates of net community production (NCP) reveal net autotrophy in the ice-free Dalton Polynya (NCP = 5-20 mmol C m(-2) day(-1)) and weakly heterotrophic waters near the ice-covered TIS (NCP = -4-0 mmol C m(-2) day(-1)). Satellite-derived estimates of chlorophyll a (Chl a) and sea ice coverage suggest that the early summer season in 2014/2015 was anomalous relative to the long-term (1997-2017) record, with lower surface Chl a concentrations and a greater degree of sea ice cover during the period of observation; the implications for seasonal primary production and air-sea CO2 exchange are discussed. This study highlights the importance of both physical and biological processes in controlling air-sea CO2 fluxes and the significant interannual variability of the CO2 system in Antarctic coastal regions.\\n   Plain Language Summary Coastal polynyas in Antarctica are dynamic regions that play important roles in the global cycling of carbon. Polynyas are reoccurring areas of open water within sea ice and are often associated with enhanced rates of photosynthesis and exchange of carbon dioxide between the atmosphere and ocean surface. In this study, we use shipboard observations from the first oceanographic cruise in the Dalton Polynya near the Totten and Moscow University Ice Shelves in East Antarctica to characterize the inorganic carbon chemistry in the summertime. We find that the surface concentrations of total dissolved inorganic carbon are reduced in areas of open water mainly as a result of seasonal sea ice melt and the uptake of inorganic carbon by photosynthesis and less so due to air-sea exchange of carbon dioxide. Compared to other coastal polynyas in East Antarctica, our results show that the Dalton Polynya may have smaller rates of net photosynthesis and carbon dioxide exchange.\\nC1 [Arroyo, M.

Observations from the Southern Ocean Flux Station provide a wide range of wind, buoyancy, and wave (Stokes drift) forcing. Two No-Stokes LES are used to determine the extent of the ocean surface layer and to adapt the nondimensional momentum and buoyancy gradients, as functions of the stability parameter. Stokes-forced LES are used to modify this parameter for wave effects, then to formulate dependencies of Stokes similarity functions on a Stokes parameter xi. To account for wind-wave misalignment, the dimensional analysis is extended with two independent variables, namely, the production of turbulent kinetic energy in the surface layer due to Stokes shear and the total production, so that their ratio gives xi. Stokes forcing is shown to reduce vertical shear more than stratification, and to enhance viscosity and diffusivity by factors up to 5.8 and 4.0, respectively, such that the Prandtl number can exceed unity. A practical parameterization is developed for xi in terms of the meteorological forcing plus a Stokes drift profile, so that the Stokes and stability similarity functions can be combined to give turbulent velocity scales. These scales for both viscosity and diffusivity are evaluated against the LES, and the correlations are nearly 0.97. The benefit of calculating Stokes drift profiles from directional wave spectra is demonstrated by similarly evaluating three alternatives.\\nC1 [Large, William G.; Patton, Edward G.; Duvivier, Alice K.; Sullivan, Peter P.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.\\n   [Romero, Leonel] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.\\nRP Large, WG (通讯作者)，Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.\\nEM wily@ucar.edu\\nRI Romero, Leonel/AAC-7936-2022; Patton, Edward/K-3607-2012\\nOI Romero, Leonel/0000-0002-4723-4176; Patton, Edward/0000-0001-5431-9541;\\n   DUVIVIER, ALICE K./0000-0001-6920-5926\\nFU U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-FOA-0001036, SC-00126005]; National\\n   Science Foundation [1852977]; Office of Naval Research\\n   [N00014-16-1-2936]; Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy\\n   [DE-AC02-05CH11231]\\nFX This work was made possible by support from the U.S. Department of\\n   Energy (DOE) under solicitation DE-FOA-0001036, Climate and Earth System\\n   Modeling: SciDAC and Climate Variability and Change, Grant SC-00126005,\\n   and the patience of Dorothy Koch is gratefully acknowledged, as are the\\n   contributions of other Principal Investigators; Todd Ringler, Gokhan\\n   Danabasoglu, and Matt Long, and constructive discussions with Dan Whitt.\\n   The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) is sponsored by the\\n   National Science Foundation under Cooperative Agreement 1852977.

We overcame these challenges with a multidecade numerical modeling analysis of seasonal, interannual, and decadal variability in net ecosystem metabolism (NEM) and associated carbon fluxes in Chesapeake Bay. Interannual variability in NEM along the estuarine axis indicated a clear spatial dependency of NEM on riverine discharge, with elevated flows causing increasing upper bay heterotrophy and increasing lower bay autotrophy during wet years. Our 30-year simulation suggested the Chesapeake Bay is somewhat unique among estuaries in its tendency toward net autotrophy as a consequence of its extremely high nutrient to organic matter input ratio and large size. Budgets of three different carbon pools revealed that the entire Chesapeake Bay is a CO2 source to the atmosphere and organic carbon source to the open shelf, providing quantitative export estimates for interpretation of anthropogenic perturbations to the regional carbon flux.\\nC1 [Shen, Chunqi; Testa, Jeremy M.] Univ Maryland, Chesapeake Biol Lab, Ctr Environm Sci, Solomons, MD 20688 USA.\\n   [Ni, Wenfei; Li, Ming; Kemp, W.

To explore the pathways and variability of flow, and the extent of tidal mixing within the canyons, moorings were placed in the Chiniak, Barnabas, and Amatuli troughs, and off the shelf from Resurrection Bay (Seward Line) and the Kenai Peninsula (Gore Point). In the troughs, intensified flow was evident near the trough walls, and flow was directed by bathymetry with inflow along the upstream (northern) side and outflow along the downstream (southern) side. The presence of mesoscale eddies in the gulf had no unique influence on currents or salinity in the troughs. Tidal mixing was strongest in Chiniak Trough, and this introduced cold, nutrient-rich bottom waters into the upper water column. Intensified bottom flow associated with the Alaskan Coastal Current was evident along the Seward Line and Gore Point, and directed toward the Kennedy-Stevenson Entrances, which are also regions of strong tidal mixing. Observations of tidal mixing were consistent with model results and satellite images showing cooler, phytoplankton-rich water in summer in the nursery grounds that surround Kodiak Island. Patterns of flow within the troughs and in Shelikof Strait were consistent with the springtime advance of ichthyoplankton across the shelf.\\nC1 [Mordy, Calvin W.; Kachel, Nancy B.; Hermann, Albert J.; Doyle, Miriam J.] Univ Washington, Joint Inst Study Atmosphere & Ocean, 3737 Brooklyn Ave NE,Box 355672, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.\\n   [Mordy, Calvin W.; Stabeno, Phyllis J.; Kachel, Nancy B.; Kachel, David; Ladd, Carol; Hermann, Albert J.] NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.\\n   [Zimmermann, Mark; Doyle, Miriam J.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.\\n   [Coyle, Kenneth O.] Univ Alaska, Inst Marine Sci, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.\\nRP Mordy, CW (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Joint Inst Study Atmosphere & Ocean, 3737 Brooklyn Ave NE,Box 355672, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.\\nEM Mordy@uw.edu; Phyllis.Stabeno@noaa.gov; Nancy.Kachel@noaa.gov;\\n   Carol.Ladd@noaa.gov; Mark.Zimmermann@noaa.gov;\\n   Albert.J.Hermann@noaa.gov; kocoyle@alaska.edu; Miriam.Doyle@noaa.gov\\nOI Zimmermann, Mark/0000-0002-5786-3814\\nFU CNES; NPRB [G83]; USGLOBEC Program; NOAA\\'s North Pacific Climate Regimes\\n   and Ecosystem Productivity (NPCREP); NOAA\\'s Fisheries Oceanography\\n   Coordinated Investigations programs; Joint Institute for the Study of\\n   the Atmosphere and Ocean (JISAO) under NOAA [NA17RJ1232, NA100AR4320148]\\nFX We thank the crews and officers of the NOAA ship Miller Freeman and RV\\n   Kilo Moana for their assistance and effort.

Its strength is directly related to the halocline depth, and therefore also to the storage of freshwater. It has recently been proposed that the equilibrium state of the BG is set by the Ice-Ocean Governor, a negative feedback between surface currents and ice-ocean stress, rather than a balance between lateral mesoscale eddy fluxes and surface Ekman pumping. However, mesoscale eddies are present in the Arctic Ocean; it is therefore important to extend the Ice-Ocean Governor theory to include lateral fluxes due to mesoscale eddies. Here, a nonlinear ordinary differential equation is derived that represents the effects of wind stress, the Ice-Ocean Governor, and eddy fluxes. Equilibrium and time-varying solutions to this three-way balance equation are obtained and shown to closely match the output from a hierarchy of numerical simulations, indicating that the analytical model represents the processes controlling BG equilibration. The equilibration timescale derived from this three-way balance is faster than the eddy equilibration timescale and slower than the Ice-Ocean Governor equilibration timescales for most values of eddy diffusivity. The sensitivity of the BG equilibrium depth to changes in eddy diffusivity and the presence of the Ice-Ocean Governor is also explored. These results show that predicting the response of the BG to changing surface forcing and sea ice conditions requires faithfully capturing the three-way balance between the Ice-Ocean Governor, wind stress, and eddy fluxes.\\nC1 [Doddridge, Edward W.; Meneghello, Gianluca; Marshall, John; Scott, Jeffery] MIT, Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.\\n   [Lique, Camille] Univ Bretagne Occidentale, Lab Oceanog Phys & Spatiale, IFREMER, CNRS,IRD,IUEM, Brest, France.\\nRP Doddridge, EW (通讯作者)，MIT, Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.\\nEM ewd@mit.edu\\nRI Lique, Camille/L-5543-2015; Meneghello, Gianluca/AAA-8494-2019\\nOI Lique, Camille/0000-0002-8357-4928; Meneghello,\\n   Gianluca/0000-0002-0767-2497; Doddridge, Edward/0000-0002-6097-5729\\nFU NSF; MIT-GISS collaborative agreement; French LEFE/INSU program\\nFX E.W.D., G.M., J.M., and J.S. gratefully acknowledge support from NSF\\n   Polar Programs, both Arctic and Antarctic.

Weather systems cause the ice pack to fracture in characteristic patterns that depend on the location and trajectory of the weather system in relation to the coast. The majority of leads associated with anticyclonic motion in the Beaufort Sea are coastal leads that form perpendicular from promontories along the coast and landfast ice edge. Between 40% and 90% (depending on location along the Beaufort coast) winter sea ice motion is associated with leads, including coastal leads, coastal flaw leads, and interior lead patterns. In winter much of the Beaufort Gyre ice drift results from ice-coast interaction, with high ice drift localized on the leeward side of fractures that propagate from the coast. In the vicinity of Point Barrow, which has the largest occurrence of coastal leads, ice drift rates are enhanced due to this ice-coast interaction. No trends in occurrence of these leads are found over the 20 winters from December 1993 to May 2013. Seasonality in the occurrence of the leads follows seasonality in the location of the Beaufort High. In order for ice to be transported from the northeast part of the Beaufort Gyre to the southwest in a single winter, anticyclones would need to break their geospatial climatic norm, needing a higher prevalence of anticyclones in the eastern Beaufort early in the season and higher prevalence in the west Canada Basin later in the season.\\nC1 [Lewis, Benjiman J.; Hutchings, Jennifer K.] Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.\\nRP Hutchings, JK (通讯作者)，Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.\\nEM jhutchings@coas.oregonstate.edu\\nFU NASA [NNX13AK36G, 80NSSC18K1026]; Coastal Marine Institute of the\\n   University of Alaska Fairbanks\\nFX This work was funded by NASA (grants NNX13AK36G and 80NSSC18K1026).

For the first time, we have investigated the impact of mesoscale features on the strong intraseasonal variability of the mixed layer depth in the Arabian Sea using simulations from a reanalysis version of the HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model and the European Centre for Mid-range Weather Forecasting ERA-Interim product. We identify and track mesoscale eddies using an eddy-tracking algorithm during strong and weak summer monsoon conditions to determine the importance of mesoscale features on mixed layer variability during strong and weak wind forcing. We identify frontal systems in the Arabian Sea and observe how they strengthen with depth throughout the summer monsoon season. To quantify the role of these features on mixed layer variability, we also explore the roles of wind forcing, evaporation, precipitation, significant wave heights, and surface heat fluxes on mixed layer variability. A mixed layer heat budget was computed in the Arabian Sea, finding a strong dominance of vertical advective entrainment followed by compensation by horizontal processes indicating strong mesoscale activity.\\n   Plain Language Summary The uppermost layer of the ocean is full of dynamic features such as frontal systems and quasi-circular circulations on the order of 10-100 km called eddies. These features actively redistribute waters throughout the oceanic surface layer in which temperature, salinity, and density is almost vertically uniform, referred to as the mixed layer. In the Arabian Sea, the mixed layer deepens twice seasonally: once in the boreal winter and once in the boreal summer. In the wintertime, cool air blows over the Arabian Sea and cools the surface, which then sinks and deepens the mixed layer. In the summer, strong southwesterly winds deepen the mixed layer and provide conditions conducive to strong eddying and frontal development. In this paper, we compare the distribution of these mesoscale features under strong (weak) wind forcing associated with heavy (scanty) rainfall conditions and referred to as strong (weak) monsoon conditions. We find through the application of an eddy-tracking algorithm, a spatial and temporal analysis of a variety of factors that impact mixed layer variability, and a heat budget analysis that there is an overall dominance of larger features in strong monsoon conditions and a higher frequency of small features in weak monsoon conditions.\\nC1 [Trott, Corinne B.; Subrahmanyam, Bulusu] Univ South Carolina, Sch Earth Ocean & Environm, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.\\n   [Nyadjro, Ebenezer S.] Univ New Orleans, Dept Phys, New Orleans, LA 70148 USA.\\nRP Trott, CB (通讯作者)，Univ South Carolina, Sch Earth Ocean & Environm, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.\\nEM ctrott@seoe.sc.edu\\nOI Trott, Corinne/0000-0002-1908-4713; BULUSU,\\n   SUBRAHMANYAM/0000-0003-3465-8065\\nFU ONR NASCar (Northern Arabian Sea Circulation-autonomous research)\\n   [N00014-15-1-2591]\\nFX This work is supported by the ONR NASCar (Northern Arabian Sea\\n   Circulation-autonomous research) award N00014-15-1-2591 awarded to B.

Five of the stations are located in the northern Bering Sea (DBO1 - SLIP stations) and the other six stations are located in the southeastern Chukchi Sea (DBO3 - UTN stations). M. calcarea abundance and biomass were analyzed from 1998 to 2014 as part of a 25 + year benthic community dataset. Results from the DFA indicate that there are two abundance trends (one increasing and one decreasing, depending on station location) for M. calcarea in the DBO1 region. Biomass data for M. calcarea in this region also indicates simultaneous increasing and decreasing trends, depending on location. In the DBO3 region, there are also both increasing and decreasing abundance trends for M. calcarea depending on location. Furthermore, DFA of biomass data in the DBO3 region indicates that M. calcarea biomass has three underlying trends among stations (one increasing, a second trend that decreases and then increases, and third that is relatively stable through time). Model results indicate that certain surface sediment characteristics (chlorophyll-a inventories, total organic carbon, and percent >= 5 phi grain size) as well as bottom water temperature are correlated with abundance and biomass of M. calcarea in these two regions. Overall, we conclude that M. calcarea abundance and biomass declined in the DBO1 region, with some spatial complexities, which is apparent principally as a northward shift of M. calcarea abundance. Since this area is a critical winter foraging habitat for the world population of a threatened diving sea duck, the spectacled eider (Somarteria fischeri), the decline and northward shift in prey is potentially significant for management of the species. By comparison, abundance of M. calcarea in the DBO3 region exhibited a southward shift in abundance away from station UTN5 and towards UTN2, suggesting that hydrographic influences on sediment composition and food supply may be key drivers for this species.\\nC1 [Goethel, Christina L.; Grebmeier, Jacqueline M.; Cooper, Lee W.] Univ Maryland, Ctr Environm Sci, Chesapeake Biol Lab, Solomon, MD 20688 USA.\\nRP Goethel, CL (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Ctr Environm Sci, Chesapeake Biol Lab, Solomon, MD 20688 USA.\\nEM cgoethel@umces.edu\\nRI Grebmeier, Jacqueline/L-9805-2013; Cooper, Lee W./E-5251-2012\\nOI Grebmeier, Jacqueline/0000-0001-7624-3568; Cooper, Lee\\n   W./0000-0001-7734-8388\\nFU National Science Foundation [ARC-1204082, ARC-1702456]; Chesapeake\\n   Biological Laboratory/UMCES\\nFX We thank the other participants of the Distributed Biological\\n   Observatory (DBO) project as well as the Captain and crews of the CCGS\\n   Sir Wilfrid Laurier, RV Alpha Helix, and USCGC Healy for help with\\n   sample collections, Alynne Bayard for GIS support and map graphics, and\\n   Vyacheslav Lyubchich for statistical method guidance.

On the Upwelling\\n   Exposed by the Surface Distribution of C-14\\nSO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS\\nLA English\\nDT Article\\nDE radiocarbon; ocean circulation; upwelling; overturning circulation\\nID ANNUAL CORAL RINGS; DISSOLVED INORGANIC RADIOCARBON; BOMB-PRODUCED\\n   RADIOCARBON; PACIFIC-OCEAN; INDIAN-OCEAN; DELTA-R; OVERTURNING\\n   CIRCULATION; RESERVOIR CORRECTIONS; SEASONAL RADIOCARBON;\\n   NATURAL-RADIOCARBON\\nAB The upwelling associated with the ocean\\'s overturning circulation is hard to observe directly. Here, a large data set of surface C-14 measurements is compiled in order to show where deep water is brought back up to the surface in the ocean basins north of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). Maps constructed from the data set show that low-C-14 deep water from the ACC is drawn up to the surface in or near the upwelling zones off Northwest Africa and Namibia in the Atlantic, off Costa Rica and Peru in the Pacific, and in the northern Arabian Sea in the Indian Ocean. Deep water also seems to be reaching the surface in the subarctic Pacific gyre near the Kamchatka Peninsula. The low-C-14 water drawn up to the surface in the upwelling zones is also shown to spread across the ocean basins. It is easily seen, for example, in the western Atlantic off Florida and in the western Pacific off New Guinea and Palau. The spreading allows one to estimate the volumes of upwelling, which, it turns out, are similar to the volumes of large-scale upwelling derived from inverse box models. This means that very large volumes of cool subsurface water are reaching the surface in and near the upwelling zonesmuch larger volumes than would be expected from the local winds.\\n   Plain Language Summary The deep layers of the ocean are filled with cold dense water that sinks from the surface near Antarctica and in the northern North Atlantic. This process is understood reasonably well. The countervailing processthe way that the dense water is brought back up to the surfaceis not as well understood. Oceanographers now agree that the ocean\\'s deep water is drawn back up to the surface (upwelled) mainly around Antarctica as part of the wind-driven overturning in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). But cool water is also known to reach the surface in upwelling zones around the ocean\\'s margins. Here we map the upwelling north of the ACC with the radioactive isotope carbon-14 and show that the deep water upwelled to the surface around Antarctica seems to be drawn up to the surface a second time in the upwelling zones. The water drawn up to the surface in the upwelling zones then flows back to the North Atlantic and sinks again to complete the cycle.\\nC1 [Toggweiler, J.

This analysis reveals that the southern Weddell Sea, which features a weak upper-ocean stratification and relatively strong thermocline, is preconditioned for exceptionally high rates of winter ventilation. This preconditioning also facilitates a strong negative feedback to winter ice growth. Idealized experiments with a 1D ice-ocean model show that the entrainment of heat into the mixed layer of this region can maintain a near-constant ice thickness over much of winter. However, this quasi-equilibrium is attained when the pycnocline is thin and supports a large temperature gradient. We find that the surface stress imparted by a powerful storm may upset this balance and lead to substantial ice melt. This response can be greatly amplified when coincident with anomalous thermocline shoaling. In more strongly stratified regions, such as near the sea ice edge of the major gyres, winter ice growth is weakly limited by the entrainment of heat into the mixed layer. Thus, the thermodynamic coupling between winter sea ice growth and ocean ventilation has significant regional variability. This regionality will influence the response of the Southern Ocean ice-ocean system to future changes in ocean stratification and surface forcing.\\nC1 [Wilson, Earle A.; Riser, Stephen C.; Campbell, Ethan C.; Wong, Annie P.

The model simulation compares reasonably with the seasonal to interannual variability of the moored current meter observations in the upper 350m or so of the Maluku Channel during 2015 and 2016. The interannual variability of the currents in the eastern Sulawesi Sea in the model is found to be associated with both the Pacific and Indian Ocean remote forcing. Lag correlation analysis and a theoretical linear wave model simulation suggest that both the equatorial Kelvin waves from the Indian Ocean and the coastally trapped Kelvin waves from the western Pacific along the Philippine coast can propagate through the Indonesian seas and arrive at the Maluku Channel. In particular, from mid-2015 to 2016 the Indian Ocean Kelvin waves are found to significantly impact the sea level anomaly variability in the Maluku Channel. The results indicate the importance of Indo-Pacific planetary waves to the interannual variability of the currents in the Sulawesi Sea at the entrance of the Indonesian seas.\\n   Plain Language Summary The Indonesian seas provide a tropical connection for the climate systems over the tropical Pacific and Indian Oceans, the dynamics of which are not clear so far. This study uses a high-resolution computer model to simulate the currents measured by an acoustic current meter attached to a deep ocean mooring in the Maluku Channel of the northeastern Indonesian seas. Based on the successful simulation, the dynamics of the interannual variations of the circulation in the Maluku Channel are studied using the model and a simplified theoretical linear model. The interannual currents and sea level variability in the Maluku Channel are found to be affected by both the Indian Ocean Kelvin waves and the Philippine coastal Kelvin waves. It is found that the Indian Ocean Kelvin waves dominate the sea level variability in the Maluku Channel from mid-2015 to 2016. In early 2015, the sea level variability in the Maluku Channel is dominated by the coastal Kelvin waves from the east Philippine coasts. The results are important for the understanding of the circulation at the entrance of the Indonesian seas and of the Indo-Pacific interactions through the propagation of the planetary waves.\\nC1 [Hu, Xiaoyue; Yuan, Dongliang; Li, Xiang; Wang, Zheng; Li, Yao; Corvianawatie, Corry] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Key Lab Ocean Circulat & Wave, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China.\\n   [Hu, Xiaoyue; Yuan, Dongliang; Corvianawatie, Corry] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.\\n   [Hu, Xiaoyue; Yuan, Dongliang; Li, Xiang; Wang, Zheng; Li, Yao] Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China.\\n   [Hu, Xiaoyue; Yuan, Dongliang; Li, Xiang; Wang, Zheng; Li, Yao] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Ocean Mega Sci, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China.\\n   [Sprintall, Janet] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.\\n   [Tranchant, Benoit; Gaspar, Philippe] CLS, Ramonville St Agne, France.\\n   [Koch-Larrouy, Ariane] LEGOS, Toulouse, France.\\n   [Koch-Larrouy, Ariane; Reffray, Guillaume] Mercator Ocean, Ramonville St Agne, France.\\n   [Nugroho, Dwiyoga] Agcy Res & Dev Marine & Fisheries, MMAF, Jakarta, Indonesia.\\n   [Corvianawatie, Corry; Surinati, Dewi] Indonesian Inst Sci, Res Ctr Oceanog, Jakarta, Indonesia.\\nRP Yuan, DL (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Key Lab Ocean Circulat & Wave, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China.; Yuan, DL (通讯作者)，Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.; Yuan, DL (通讯作者)，Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China.; Yuan, DL (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Ocean Mega Sci, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China.\\nEM dyuan@qdio.ac.cn\\nRI Surinati, Dewi/ABE-2388-2021\\nOI Surinati, Dewi/0000-0001-7093-8270; Sprintall,\\n   Janet/0000-0002-7428-7580; KOCH-LARROUY, Ariane/0000-0002-9850-0518;\\n   Gaspar, Philippe/0000-0002-1477-1215\\nFU National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41421005,\\n   41720104008, 41876025]; Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA11010205];\\n   Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology (QNLM)\\n   Project [2016ASKJ04]; Shandong Provincial Project [U1606402]; China\\n   Scholarship Council (CSC); NOAA\\'s Climate Program Office, Climate\\n   Variability, and Predictability Program [NA17OAR4310257]\\nFX The study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of\\n   China (NSFC) (41421005, 41720104008, and 41876025), the Strategic\\n   Priority Project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDA11010205), the\\n   Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology (QNLM)\\n   Project (2016ASKJ04), and the Shandong Provincial Project (U1606402).\\n   The first author gratefully acknowledges the China Scholarship Council\\n   (CSC) support for the Joint Ph.D. Training Program at Scripps\\n   Institution of Oceanography, University of California, San Diego.

Ocean baroclinicity is incorporated through one-way coupling from operational data-assimilated Global Ocean Forecasting System 3.1 temperature and salinity fields at just 12% additional computational time. The main objectives are to provide a comprehensive analysis of observed and modeled coastal sea levels (spanning from seasonal to supertidal variations) in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands during 2017 and to evaluate the associated model performance with and without baroclinic coupling at 14 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/National Ocean Service tide gauges deployed in the region. It is found that baroclinic coupling increases modeled energy across the entire frequency spectrum, which is more commensurate with observations. In particular, density-driven effects such as the seasonal cycle and sea level setdown due to trailing cold wakes from passing hurricanes are largely reproduced. Supertidal shelf-resonant seiching at one to two cycles per hour is observed and modeled at a number of locations, where excitation of these modes is often promoted by the baroclinic coupling. Baroclinicity improves the yearlong model skill at every tide gauge, where the mean total skill is increased from 87% to 93% accuracy (54% to 85% for the nontidal residual). In September 2017 during Hurricanes Irma and Maria, baroclinicity increases model skill at 10 out of 14 tide gauges even when the barotropic mode is adjusted to have no mean offset from the observations.\\n   Plain Language Summary Computer simulations (models) with fine scales at the coast are required to accurately forecast coastal water levels potentially causing flooding. Often these computer models only account for the effects of winds and air pressure (creating surge), and gravity from the Moon and the Sun (creating tides), ignoring the effects of ocean density because of the large computational expense required. In this study we present an approach to incorporate ocean density effects into the fine-scale model by using information from an existing coarse-scaled ocean model already in operation. This results in a small and manageable 12% increase to computational run-times. The approach is assessed by comparing model results to measured coastal sea levels during 2017 around Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. It is found that a range of density-induced variations in coastal sea levels could be reproduced such as those related to seasonal heating-cooling cycles, and temporary cooling of the local ocean surface due to 2017 Hurricanes Maria and Irma. Measures of model accuracy show that the inclusion of ocean density leads to improvements in the simulation of yearly coastal water levels at every location tested. Based on the positive results this approach may be useful for improving existing operational forecast computer simulations.\\nC1 [Pringle, William J.; Joyce, Brian R.; Westerink, Joannes J.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Civil & Environm Engn & Earth Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.\\n   [Gonzalez-Lopez, Juan] Wood E&IS Met Ocean Serv, Dartmouth, NS, Canada.\\n   [van der Westhuysen, Andre J.] NOAA, IMSG, NWS, NCEP,Environm Modeling Ctr, 5830 Univ Res Court, College Pk, MD USA.\\nRP Pringle, WJ (通讯作者)，Univ Notre Dame, Dept Civil & Environm Engn & Earth Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.\\nEM wpringle@nd.edu\\nRI Pringle, William/V-9940-2019\\nOI Pringle, William/0000-0002-2877-4812; Joyce, Brian/0000-0001-6179-8480\\nFU NOAA\\'s National Ocean Service; U.S. IOOS Coastal and Ocean Modeling\\n   Testbed; Southeastern Universities Research Association (SURA) (NOAA\\n   Center for Weather and Climate Prediction) [NA13NOS0120139];\\n   Southeastern Universities Research Association (SURA) (University of\\n   Notre Dame) [PTX-SURA-2013-008]\\nFX The authors would like to thank the Southeastern Universities Research\\n   Association (SURA), awards NA13NOS0120139 (NOAA Center for Weather and\\n   Climate Prediction) and PTX-SURA-2013-008 (University of Notre Dame),\\n   NOAA\\'s National Ocean Service and the U.S. IOOS Coastal and Ocean\\n   Modeling Testbed for supporting the work presented here.

We used infrared based satellite SSTs to obtain strong SST signals. The objective analysis data on surface wind, air temperature and relative humidity patterns was used to explain possible mechanisms responsible for the observed phenomena. Although easterly winds are frequently accompanied by clouds that hinder frequent observation of SSTs from space, four cases of high SST were obtained under clear sky conditions. The results show that high resolution satellite data can capture SSTs of more than 5 degrees C. Further, the SST variation was strongly influenced by topography. The existence of mountains near the study area have the effect of blocking the easterly winds, creating a low wind speed area on the lee side of the mountain range, which is responsible for the generation of high SST, especially in the offshore area. In addition to the topographic effect, the SST values measured in the in-shore area were influenced by the sea breeze. The warm-dry air mass is advected to the coastal seas by the anti-sea breeze which heats the in-shore area and keeps the SST at the same level as that of the offshore area. This finding highlights the importance of understanding air, sea and land interactions in terms of the variation observed in SST in the study area.\\nC1 [Wirasatriya, Anindya; Helmi, Muhammad] Diponegoro Univ, Fisheries & Marine Sci Fac, Dept Oceanog, Jl Prof Sudarto, Tembalang 50275, Semarang, Indonesia.\\n   [Wirasatriya, Anindya; Helmi, Muhammad] Diponegoro Univ, Ctr Coastal Rehabil & Disaster Mitigat Studies, Lab Terpadu Lt 1,Jl Prof Sudarto SH, Tembalang 50275, Semarang, Indonesia.\\n   [Kawamura, Hiroshi] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Ctr Atmospher & Ocean Studies, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan.\\n   [Koch, Magaly] Boston Univ, Ctr Remote Sensing, Boston, MA 02215 USA.\\nRP Wirasatriya, A (通讯作者)，Diponegoro Univ, Fisheries & Marine Sci Fac, Dept Oceanog, Jl Prof Sudarto, Tembalang 50275, Semarang, Indonesia.; Wirasatriya, A (通讯作者)，Diponegoro Univ, Ctr Coastal Rehabil & Disaster Mitigat Studies, Lab Terpadu Lt 1,Jl Prof Sudarto SH, Tembalang 50275, Semarang, Indonesia.\\nEM aninosi@yahoo.co.id\\nRI Wirasatriya, Anindya/P-4681-2017; Koch, Magaly/B-3467-2017\\nOI Wirasatriya, Anindya/0000-0003-1030-5126; Koch,\\n   Magaly/0000-0002-6186-1619\\nFU Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education\\n   (KEMENRISTEK-DIKTI) of the Republic of Indonesia [168.A10/D2/KP/2017]\\nFX We gratefully thank the support from the Ministry of Research,\\n   Technology and Higher Education (KEMENRISTEK-DIKTI) of the Republic of\\n   Indonesia through the World Class Professor Program (No.\\n   168.A10/D2/KP/2017).

Few instruments are capable of sampling from such great depths. We have developed a full-ocean-depth-capable lander that can be fit with sampling packages for the collection of still images, video, motile megafauna, and hadal seawater. One payload includes a pressure-retaining sampler (PRS) able to maintain seawater samples under in situ pressure during recovery. We describe the technical specifications of the lander and the PRS and preliminary results from three deployments at depths in excess of 10,700 m in the Mariana Trench. Seawater from full-ocean depth was recovered at 81% of the in situ pressure. This facilitated the collection of microbial genomes affiliated with the family Flavobacteriaceae within the Bacteroidetes and the phylum Marinimicrobia. We show that these microbes are specifically enriched in hadal zones, representing novel trench lineages, and describe their adaptations for living in hadal environments. These findings highlight the utility of this lander system, which facilitates scientific inquiry at depths greater than 6000 m.\\nC1 [Peoples, Logan M.; Bartlett, Douglas H.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Marine Biol Res Div, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.\\n   [Norenberg, Matthew; McGoldrick, Madeline] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Inst Geophys & Planetary Phys, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.\\n   [Price, David] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Marine Phys Lab, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.\\n   [Novotny, Mark] J Craig Venter Inst, Microbial & Environm Genom, San Diego, CA 92121 USA.\\n   [Bochdansky, Alexander] Old Dominion Univ, Ocean Earth & Atmospher Sci, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA.\\nRP Bartlett, DH (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, 9500 Gilman Dr 0202, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.\\nEM dbartlett@ucsd.edu\\nFU National Science Foundation [OCE1536776]; National Aeronautics and Space\\n   Administration [NNX14AP13H, 09-EXOB09-0048]; Schmidt Ocean Institute; UC\\n   Ship Funds\\nFX We thank Larry Herbst and Kevin Hardy for their help with the camera\\n   system.

Bedforms observed on sidescan sonar images are predominantly 10-20 m wavelength dunes with flood-oriented slip faces within the section of the sandbank field studied. The sandbanks separate mutually evasive ebb- and flood-dominant sand transport pathways. Rates of sand transport, calculated from the current meter data, are greatest during flood tides, flowing between the interval low-low to high-high water (mixed tidal regime). Subordinate, ebb-directed transport is insignificant by comparison, which facilitates the preservation of flood-oriented foreset beds in high energy depositional settings (i.e. sandbank crests). Sediment peels obtained from cores indicate that foreset beds are preserved only in deposits of the sandbank crests; trough deposits show bioturbation.C-14 dating establishes that sandbanks located further away from Moreton Island were formed prior to 3 k.y. B.P. and that the banks have not been rebuilt since this time. In contrast, material obtained up to 380 cm beneath the surface in sandbanks located inshore are of modern age, showing that these banks undergo regular rebuilding. The formation of linear sandbanks in Moreton Bay is mainly a consequence of the infilling of the bay mouth with sand delivered via littoral drift along the adjacent coastline.\\nOI Pattiaratchi, Charitha/0000-0003-2229-6183\\nTC 48\\nZ9 52\\nSN 0025-3227\\nPD JAN 1992\\nPY 1992\\nVL 103.0\\nIS 1-3\\nBP 225\\nEP 247\\nDI 10.1016/0025-3227(92)90018-D\\nUT WOS:A1992HG30800013\\n'"
